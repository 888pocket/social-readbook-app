West Wing S01E01
The entire White House staff bristles with activity when it's learned that the President (Martin Sheen) injured himself during a bicycle accident, and his absence becomes a factor as chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) must juggle a host of impending crises, including a mass boat lift of Cuban refugees approaching the Florida coast and the reaction of conservative Christians to a controversial televised comment by deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford). Meanwhile, Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), the trouble-prone deputy communications director, unknowingly spends the night with a call girl (Lisa Edelstein) and then makes another critical error during a children's White House tour.

ACT ONE

WAITER [VO]
Two Absolut Martinis up; another Dewars rocks.

FADE IN: INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - GEORGETOWN - NIGHT
SAM SEABORN is sitting with a reporter, BILLY KENWORTHY, in the bar.

SAM SEABORN
I don’t think we’re going to run the table, if that’s what you’re asking.

BILLY KENWORTHY [OS]
It’s not.

SAM
I know.

BILLY [OS]
Deep background. I’m not going to come close to using your name.

SAM
[laughs] You’re not going to come close to getting a quote, either.

BILLY
Why are we sitting here?

SAM
[taking a drink] You sat down.

BILLY
Is Josh on his way out?
f
SAM
No.

BILLY
Is he?

SAM
No.

BILLY
I know he’s your friend.

SAM
He is.

BILLY
Did Caldwell say...?

SAM
Billy, I’m not talking about this.

BILLY
Who do I call?

SAM
No one.

BILLY
Just tell me who to call.

SAM
Well, you could call 1-800-BITE-ME.

BILLY
Sam.

SAM
He’s not going anywhere, Billy. It’s a non-story.

BILLY
Okay. You’re lying now, aren’t you?

SAM
That hurts, Billy. Why would I lie to a journalist of all people?

BILLY
Why do you keep looking over my shoulder?

SAM
Why?

BILLY
Yes.

SAM
‘Cause Alger Hiss just walked in with my secret pumpkin.

BILLY
What?

SAM
There’s a woman over there. I think she’s looking at me.

BILLY
Really?

SAM
I don’t know. I never know if they’re looking or not.

Billy turns 180 degrees to see a woman sitting on a couch with a drink. She looks 
to see him obviously eying at her. Sam sighs.

BILLY
Yeah, I think she was.

SAM
I want to thank you for the casual way that you did that just now. She probably 
didn’t notice that.

Sam makes eye contact with the woman and smiles.

CUT TO: EXT. DAWN RISING OVER LARGE TUDOR STYLE HOUSE - DAY
CUT TO: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
LEO McGARRY is doing a crossword puzzle while eating breakfast. A television is 
turned on to the news.

LEO McGARRY
17 across is wrong. It’s just wrong. Do you believe that Ruth?

RUTH
You should call them.

LEO
I will call them.

WOMAN [OS]
Telephone, Leo.

LEO
I’m in the shower.

WOMAN [OS]
It’s POTUS.

LEO
[sits down and picks up the phone] Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY

C.J. CREGG is running on a treadmill while talking to the man using the treadmill 
next to her.

C.J. CREGG
You can have a normal life. You’d be amazed at how normal I can be. See, it’s all 
about budgeting your time. This time, this hour, this is my time. Five a.m. to six 
a.m. I can workout, as you see. I can think about personal matters. I can meet an 
interesting man. [Her beeper goes off.] The trick is...

MAN
Your beeper’s going.

C.J.
What?

MAN
I think your beeper is going.

C.J. checks her beeper while still running on the treadmill. What she finds on her 
beeper is distracting, however, and she falls off the machine.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH LYMAN’S OFFICE - DARK
In the dark office, JOSH LYMAN is asleep at his cluttered desk as a custodian 
vacuums the floor. His beeper goes off, waking him up. He checks his beeper, then 
picks up the phone and quickly dials.

JOSH
Yeah. This is Josh Lyman. What’s going on?

CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DARK
The shades are drawn and many of the passengers are sleeping, except TOBY ZIEGLER, 
who is busy typing on his laptop.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1 [VO]
We ask at this time that you turn off all electronic devices, stow your tray tables 
and return your setbacks to the full and upright position. We will be landing 
shortly at Washington-Dulles Airport.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
[approaches Toby] Sir, I need you to turn off your computer.

TOBY ZIEGLER
I’m just about done.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
I need you to turn off your laptop, sir. It interferes with our navigational systems.

TOBY
You know when you guys say that, it sounds ridiculous to most people, right?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
Sir...

Another Flight Attendant approaches.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 3
Mr. Ziegler? A message was just patched up to the cockpit for you. I’m not sure 
I’ve got it right. POTUS in a bicycle accident?

TOBY
[stops typing and looks up] You got it right. [reaches for his cell phone]

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
You can’t use your phone until we land, sir.

TOBY
We’re flying in a Lockheed eagle series L-1011. It came off the line 20 months ago 
and carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still 
flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
You can call when we land, sir.

TOBY
[calling as she walks away] Also, I never got my peanuts.

CUT TO:

INT. A BEDROOM - DAY

Lying on the bed is the woman in the bar. Her name is LAURIE. She is lying on the 
bed smoking pot.

LAURIE
How ya doing, Sam?

SAM [OS]
Let me tell you something. The water pressure in here is really impressive.

LAURIE
I know.

SAM
[walking out of the bathroom, having taken a shower] You could run hydraulics in here.

LAURIE
Want some? [referring to pot]

SAM
I’m fine.

LAURIE
I’m wasted.

SAM
And probably free of cataracts.

LAURIE
I get that. That’s funny.

SAM
Thank you.

LAURIE
Oh, wait. I’m sorry. Your message -- your pager went off while you were in the 
shower. I hit the button because I thought it was mine.

Sam reads the beeper, while Laurie recites the message.

LAURIE
‘POTUS in a bicycle accident. Come to the office.’

Sam rushes to get dressed.

LAURIE [cont.]
I memorized it just in case I erased it on accident. [looks at both her and Sam’s 
pager, comparing them] These things look exactly alike. Anyway, like I said, I’m 
totally baked. But um -- no, it’s not like I’m a drug person. I just love pot. 

SAM
[slightly preoccupied] Um, Laurie, I to have to go.

LAURIE
You’re kidding me. It’s five thirty in the morning.

SAM
I know this doesn’t look good.

LAURIE
Not that good. No.

SAM
You know what? I really like you. And if you give me your number, I’d like to call you.

LAURIE
Stay right here and save yourself a call.

SAM
It’s not that I don’t see the logic in that, but I really gotta go.

LAURIE
‘Cause POTUS was in a bicycle accident?

SAM
Yup.

LAURIE
[writes her number on a piece of paper, grabs one of the beepers and puts them in 
Sam's shirt pocket, while giving him a kiss] Tell your friend, POTUS, he’s got a 
funny name. And he should learn how to ride a bicycle.

SAM
I would, but he’s not my friend, he’s my boss; and it’s not his name, it’s his title.

LAURIE
POTUS?

SAM
President of the United States. I’ll call you.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Leo walks past several security checks and continues down the hallway. He passes a 
security officer, Mike, who is sitting behind a desk.

MIKE
It’s a nice morning, Mr. McGarry.

LEO
We’ll take care of that in a hurry. Won’t we, Mike?

MIKE
Yes, sir.

BONNIE
Don’t kill the messenger, Leo. [hands him some papers]

LEO
Oh, why the hell not, Bonnie?

BONNIE
Five minutes.

LEO
Please. [continues through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA] Hey, Emma.

EMMA
Morning.

LEO
Wilson.

WILSON
Hey, Leo.

LEO
Joe.

JEFFREY
It’s Jeffrey.

LEO
Whatever. 

He winds up at the desk of DONNA MOSS.

LEO
[calls] Josh!

DONNA MOSS
Morning, Leo.

LEO
Hey, Donna. Is he in yet?

DONNA
[stirring her coffee] Yeah.

LEO
Can you get him?

DONNA
[yells] Josh!

LEO
Thanks.

DONNA
I heard it’s broken.

LEO
You heard wrong.

DONNA
I heard--

LEO
It’s a mild sprain. He’ll be back later today.

DONNA
And what was the cause of the accident?

LEO
What are you, from State Farm? Go. Do a job, would ya?

DONNA
I’m just...

LEO
He was swerving to avoid a tree.

DONNA
And what happened?

LEO
He was unsuccessful.

Leo walks into JOSH'S OFFICE.

JOSH
[talking on the phone] Yeah. That’s fine. Just don’t do anything until Justice. 
Okay, bye. [hangs up the phone] Hey.

LEO
How many Cubans, exactly, have crammed themselves into these fishing boats?

JOSH
It’s important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren’t fishing boats. 
You hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first of all. 
What the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They’re making 
the hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let’s just be clear on that.

LEO
We are.

JOSH
Donna’s desk, if it could float, would look good to them right now.

LEO
I get it. How many are there?

JOSH
We don’t know.

LEO
What time, exactly, did they leave?

JOSH
We don’t know.

LEO
Do we know when they get here?

JOSH
No.

LEO
True or False: If I were to stand on high ground in Key West with a good pair of 
binoculars, I would be as informed as I am right now.

JOSH
That’s true.

LEO
The intelligence budget’s money well spent, isn’t it?

They begin to walk through the busy HALLWAY continuing their conversation.

JOSH
Tell them to send the Coast Guard, Leo.

LEO
The Coast Guard won’t...

JOSH
I understand! But, they’re never going to make it to our territorial waters.

LEO
Thank you.

JOSH
What if the D.A. suspected they had drugs?

LEO
Does the D.A. suspect they have drugs?

JOSH
We could make a phone call.

LEO
Josh!

JOSH
If the D.A. or Navy Intel thought the Cubans were bringing in drugs, wouldn’t we 
have to go out there and search those rafts with, you know, guns and blankets?

LEO
You look like hell. You know that, don’t you?

JOSH
Yes. I do. Listen, Leo. Did he say anything?

LEO
Did he say anything?! The President’s pissed as hell at you, Josh. And so am I.

JOSH
[sighs] I know.

LEO
You gotta work with these people. And where the hell do you get off strutting your...

They are walking through the ROOSEVELT ROOM.

JOSH
I know.

LEO
Al Caldwell is a good man. 

JOSH
Al Caldwell wasn’t there.

LEO
I’m saying, you take everyone on the Christian Right, dump them into one big pile, 
and label them ‘stupid’. We need these people.

JOSH
We do not need these people.

LEO
Josh.

JOSH
We need Al Caldwell. We want Al Caldwell. We do not need John Van Dyke. And we do 
not need Mary Marsh.

LEO
And I think there shouldn’t be instant replay in football, but that’ s not my call, 
now, is it?

JOSH
[stops walking, while Leo continues on] It was stupid.

LEO
Damn straight.

JOSH
I was right, though.

LEO
[talking to himself] Like I don’t know that.

Leo walks into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE where MRS. LANDINGHAM stands up from her desk.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Oh, Mr. McGarry. Have they done an X-Ray?

LEO
Yup.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Is anything broken?

LEO
A $4,000 Lynex Titanium touring bike that I swore I’d never lend anyone.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[following Leo into the OVAL OFFICE] I don’t understand. How did he...?

LEO
He’s a klutz, Mrs. Landingham. Your President’s a geek.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. McGarry, you know how I feel about that kind of talk in the Oval Office.

LEO
I apologize.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Just in this room, Mr. McGarry. That’s all I’m asking.

LEO
Yes. [walks out of the Oval Office and sees Bonnie] Oh, Bonnie. Call O.E.O.B. and 
set up a briefing for the Vice President. Let’s coordinate with Katie Simon’s office 
on the appointments.

BONNIE
Should I get everybody in?

LEO
Yeah! [He walks into his office.] Margaret. Please call the editor of the New York 
Times crossword and tell him that ‘Khaddafi’ is spelled with an h, and two d’s, and 
isn’t a seven letter word for anything.

MARGARET
Is this for real? Or is this just funny?

LEO
Apparently, it’s neither.

LEO’S OFFICE. The senior staff is beginning to gather. Several secretaries and 
assistants wonder in and out of the office.

C.J.
Is there anything I can say, other than the President rode his bicycle into a tree?

LEO
He hopes never to do it again.

C.J.
Seriously. They’re laughing pretty hard.

LEO
He rode his bicycle into a tree, C.J.. What do you want me to -- “The President, 
while riding a bicycle on his vacation in Jackson Hole, came to a sudden arboreal 
stop” -- What do you want from me?

C.J.
A little love, Leo.

LEO
[to Sam] What do you know about the Cubans?

SAM
I don’t know anymore than Josh. Somewhere between 1200 and 2000 Cubans began 
embarking from a fishing village 30 miles South of Havana.

STAFFER
Where are they headed?

JOSH
Vegas.

SAM
Miami. Though, it’s not clear how sophisticated their navigation equipment is.

JOSH
Navigational equipment? That way is North, I think is pretty...

C.J.
Josh.

JOSH
C.J., if one of these guys could throw a split fingered fastball, we’d send in the 
USS Eisenhower.

C.J.
That’s not entirely true.

TOBY
Oh, for God’s sake. Forget about the journey. Okay? The voyage is not our problem.

C.J.
What’s our problem?

TOBY
What to do when the Nina, the Pinta, and the Get-Me-The-Hell-Outta-Here hit Miami.

LEO
Sam?

SAM
Can’t send them back. They’ll go to jail, if they’re lucky.

TOBY
We’ll get whacked in what? At least...

SAM
Three congressional districts. Dade County.

TOBY
Those seats are gone.

JOSH
Not to mention the fact that it’s wrong.

SAM
Plus that.

JOSH
What about Texas?

SAM
I wouldn’t worry about it.

LEO
Keep Josh in the loop on this throughout the day.

SAM
Me?

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
The thing is, my day is a little tight...

TOBY
Deal with it.

SAM
And I’m happy to. It’s just that...

LEO
Sam.

SAM
I’m just saying, isn’t this more of a military area?

The room goes silent as everyone digests Sam's argument in shock.

LEO
Military?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
You think the United States is under attack from 1200 Cubans in rowboats?

SAM
I’m not saying I don’t like our chances.

TOBY
Mind-boggling to me that we ever won an election.

LEO
Pat Thomas wants to call up the Guard.

JOSH
He shouldn’t.

SAM
He’s right.

C.J.
You send in the Guard, you create a panic situation.

TOBY
I agree with Josh. And I agree with C.J.. And I agree with Sam. And you know how 
that makes me crazy.

LEO
Yeah...

TOBY
They’re running for their lives. You don’t have to start a game of Red Rover with 
Castro. But you don’t send in the National Guard. You send food and you send doctors. 

JOSH
Sam, see that I.N.S. is working with the Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control.

SAM
I’ve got my guy from CDC on the phone right...

LEO
Go. Talk to him.

SAM
Talk to him. [leaves]

LEO
Moving on. Let’s talk about Josh.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY
Reporters are milling about. Billy is talking to a female reporter.

BILLY
Al Caldwell scares the hell out of the President, and Josh knows it.

WOMAN
He’s not going to fire him.

BILLY
He’s got no choice.

WOMAN
Billy, the President’s not going to fire Josh Lyman.

BILLY
He doesn’t have a choice.

Buzzer sounds to announce the start of a press briefing. They start to walk to the 
Briefing Room.

BILLY
[continuing] Listen, I had drinks with Sam Seaborn last night.

WOMAN
And Sam said that the President was going to fire Josh?

BILLY
He needs these people. He’s going to have to give them Josh.

C.J.
[walks to the podium and begins to address The White House Press Corps]
Folks? Folks?

WOMAN
Billy, what do you think if he just--

BILLY
He doesn’t have a choice.

C.J.
Good morning. Dr. Randall Haymen, H-A-Y-M-E-N, chief of orthopedics at St. John’s 
Hospital has diagnosed the President with a mild sprain in his left ankle sustained 
while cycling into a large cyprus tree.

The Press Corps laughs.

C.J.
Details can be found in the full report that Linda and Susanne are distributing.  
Along with pool photographs of the President resisting help from a Secret Service 
agent, then falling down again. By all means, enjoy yourselves. Item number two.

CHRIS
C.J., has the President...?

C.J.
It’s a light day, Chris. Let’s just get through this, then I’ll take a couple 
questions. Item number two, the Association of Retired...

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
All of the lights are out. Josh flips on a television and starts a video tape. 
It is of a round table discussion show called ‘Capitol Beat.’ On the show, Josh 
is sitting next to MARY MARSH.

JOSH [on video]
--none of your business. Look, if 38 states...

MARY [on video]
No. Well, I can tell you that you don’t believe in any God I pray to, Mr. Lyman. 
Not any God I pray to.

JOSH [on video]
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted for tax fraud. 
[rewinds the tape back]

MARY [on video]
I can tell you that you don’t believe in any God I pray to, Mr. Lyman. Not any God 
I pray to.

JOSH [on video]
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted for tax fraud. [rewinds again]
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted-

DONNA
[enters the office, holding a coffee mug] You shouldn’t have worn that tie on 
television. It bleeds.

JOSH
I don’t think it was the tie that got me in trouble.

DONNA
No, but I’ve told you a zillion times.

JOSH
What’s that?

DONNA
It’s coffee.

JOSH
Thought so.

DONNA
I brought you some coffee.

JOSH
What’s going on, Donna?

DONNA
Nothing’s going on.

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
I brought you some coffee.

JOSH
Close the door. [Donna sets the coffee on his desk and closes the door.] 
Donnatella Moss, when did you start working for me?

DONNA
Um, during the campaign.

JOSH
And how long have you been my assistant?

DONNA
A year and a half.

JOSH
And when was the last time you brought me a cup of coffee? [beat] It was never. 
You’ve never brought me a cup of coffee.

DONNA
Well, if you’re going to make a big deal out of it...

JOSH
Donna. If I get fired, I get fired.

DONNA
Do you think he’s going to do it?

JOSH
[beat] No.

A knock on the door.

TOBY [OS]
It’s Toby.

DONNA
You won that election for him. You, and Leo, and C.J., and Sam.

More knocks on the door.

TOBY [OS]
Open the damn door.

DONNA
[whispering] And him. [opens the door to reveal Toby and walks out of the office]

JOSH
Thanks for the coffee.

DONNA
You’re welcome.

TOBY
Donna brought you coffee?

DONNA [OS]
Shut up.

JOSH
‘Sup?

TOBY
[shutting the door] What did I tell you before you went on the air yesterday?

JOSH
You said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’

TOBY
I said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’ I said Al Caldwell is not to be treated 
like some revival tent clown.

JOSH
Al Caldwell wasn’t there.

TOBY
He sure as hell was watching.

JOSH
Look, I already took Leo’s morning beating. What do you want?

TOBY
I want you to keep your job.

JOSH
[beat] How?

TOBY
I’m going to make a suggestion, which might help you out. But I don’t want this 
gesture to be mistaken for an indication that I like you.

JOSH
I understand.

TOBY
In preparation for the Sunday morning radio address on family values...

JOSH
When did that get on the schedule?

TOBY
Listen to me for a second...

JOSH
When did it get on the schedule?

TOBY
It’s the regular Sunday morning...

JOSH
[raising his voice] Yeah, but when did we schedule family values?

TOBY
We scheduled it, Josh, after your smug, taunting, you know, calamitous performance 
on ‘Capitol Beat.’ [beat] America for better families. The AAF and Al Caldwell. 
Mary Marsh. I’ve invited them all for coffee this afternoon, along with a couple 
of speechwriters to talk about...

JOSH
What they want to hear.

TOBY
Yes. Yes, sir.

JOSH
If you listen carefully, you can hear two centuries of Presidents rolling over in 
their graves.

TOBY
Come to the meeting.

JOSH
No!

TOBY
Come to the meeting and be nice.

JOSH
Why?

TOBY
So C.J. can put it in the papers...

JOSH
[raising his voice] Al Caldwell is friends with bad people! I think he should say 
so for the common good. Screw politics! How about that?

TOBY
[raising his voice] You don’t run social policy for this government. How ‘bout that!

JOSH
Toby! 

TOBY
I’m in charge of the message around here. It’s my job to tell the President that 
the best thing he could do, from a PR standpoint, is to show you the door. [beat]
Come to the meeting. Be nice. Keep your job.

JOSH
[softly] I’ll be there.

TOBY
[remembering] Oh, take a look at this. [hands Josh a newspaper clipping]

JOSH
What’s that?

TOBY
One of the kids from the newsroom clipped that from the Journal this morning. 
Guess who’s leaving Lennox-Chase to start consulting in town? She’s leasing 
offices downtown. She starts today.

JOSH
Who’s she working for?

TOBY
[smiles] I’m checking it out.

Toby leaves the office as Josh sits down, still looking at the newspaper clipping.

JOSH
[to himself] That’s a good picture of her.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY
MANDY HAMPTON is driving a silver convertible very fast, while talking on her cell phone.

MANDY 
[on the phone] Bruce? Bruce? Bruce! I may have just gotten back into the business 
this morning, but I didn’t come by way of a turnip truck, you know what I’m saying?
[pause] You jerk me around on this, and I’m going to get cranky right in your face. 
Now, I was your source on 443. Big, fat byline. Above the fold. So, I think it’s 
time to play ‘What have you done for me lately.’ Look, I don’t want to hear you’re 
going to try, Bruce. This isn’t gym class.

A police officer on motorcycle watches Mandy run a red light and follows her, 
his siren blaring.

MANDY 
[on the phone] I said, gym class. Gym class! [pulls her car to the side of the road 
and stops, still talking to Bruce.] Bruce, Bruce! ‘Cause it’s important in gym to 
try, but it is not necessarily- Look, Bruce. It was a simple metaphor. Now listen 
up! Now, you’re misinterpreting me and you’re misinterpreting the Senator. And it’s 
bush league for the party. And it’s beneath even you’re newspaper.

POLICE OFFICER
[approaches] You know you ran a red light back there.

MANDY
[turns away, still on the phone] Come on. Bruce, please. You huckling me out, I just 
wanna make you cry like a girl.

POLICE OFFICER
Put the phone down, please!

MANDY
Listen, I’m under arrest. I’m going to have to call you back, Bruce.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM- DAY
Leo is meeting with economic advisors.

FRED
A two and a half percent in the third quarter at the end of the fiscal year.

LEO
That’s fine, but the President’s gonna look at the WBO revenue analysis and say 
that economists were put on this planet to make astrologers look good.

Josh walks into the room as several people in the room laugh.

FRED
Leo...

LEO
Luther. Ballpark. One year from today. Where’s the Dow?

LUTHER
Tremendous. Up a thousand.

LEO
Fred. One year from today.

FRED
Not good. Down a thousand.

LEO
A year from today at least one of you is gonna look pretty stupid.

LUTHER
Can we go now?

LEO
Oh, go. Get out. [The economists all leave.]

SAM
[walks in] There’s a storm system moving into the South Florida area.

LEO
See, with any luck the Cubans’ll turn around and live to defect another day.

JOSH
Yeah, ‘cause they’re probably all tuned to the National Weather Service, but that’s 
not what I’m here for.

LEO
What’s on your mind?

JOSH
We’ve gotta look at the whole field for a minute, ‘cause I think we’re about to 
get tagged.

LEO
With regard to what?

JOSH
Re-election.

LEO
Oh, we’re not there.

JOSH
Don’t let Lloyd Russell push us around on Medicare or medium range missiles.

LEO
You’re taking Lloyd Russell too seriously.

SAM
His numbers are starting to get interesting.

JOSH
Hollywood likes him. He can raise money.

LEO
We’re not there yet.

JOSH
30 second hypothetical: You’re Lloyd Russell, newly crowned prince of the White 
suburban woman, the upper middle class Black man and teacher’s union. You’re no 
friend to the sitting President. What do you do?

LEO
Put together an exploratory committee.

JOSH
And who do you get to run it?

LEO
You.

JOSH
I already got a job.

LEO
For the moment.

JOSH
Who do you get?

LEO
Well, if I could get Mandy to leave 900,000 a year at Lennox-Chase, I’d get Mandy.

JOSH
You’d be smart.

LEO
[to Sam] Hey, come to think of it, you think she’d be interested in his job?

JOSH
You’re in luck.

LEO
She’s in town?

JOSH
Just got here today.

LEO
What she doing?

JOSH
Working for Lloyd Russell.

LEO
[digests the new information then calls] Margaret! Get me Senator Russell’s office 
on the phone.

Josh and Sam stand in the doorway and watch Leo leave.

SAM
Is that the same suit you wore yesterday?

JOSH
Yeah. [beat] You? 

SAM
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. DINER - DAY
At the bar, two female college students are gazing over at a table off screen.

STUDENT 1
I think it’s him.

STUDENT 2
It is.

STUDENT 1
Okay. I’m going over there.

The two students grab a magazine from their table as we follow them over to where 
Josh and Mandy are sitting.

STUDENT 2
Excuse me.

STUDENT 1
We’re sorry to interrupt your lunch...

STUDENT 2
We’re juniors at Florida State...

STUDENT 1
We’re with this poly-sci group...

STUDENT 2
Anyway...

STUDENT 1
Anyway, we just wanted to say that we think you’re excellent, and could we have 
your autograph. [hands Josh a magazine, which he takes and starts to sign]

JOSH
Sure. [nodding over with his head as he writes] This is Mandy Hampton. She’s 
excellent, too.

STUDENT 1
From the campaign?

STUDENT 2
Didn’t you two used to be a thing?

STUDENT 1
Jennifer!

STUDENT 2
Sorry.

JOSH
She used to steal money from me.

STUDENT 1
Really?

JOSH
Yeah. Thanks a lot for stopping by.

STUDENTS 
Thanks.

JOSH
Sure.

STUDENTS 
Bye.

JOSH
See ya. [The students leave.]

MANDY
Listen. You called me. What do you wanna know? Is Lloyd gonna run?

JOSH
I really don’t care one way or the other. He’s a lightweight. I just...

MANDY
You don’t like him.

JOSH
Not when I can’t use him. No. I just wanna know how much trouble he’s gonna be on 
the budget surplus.

MANDY
You should get to know him.

JOSH
I have enough friends.

MANDY
Not these days you don’t.

JOSH
Please, Mandy. It’s not like these people were in our camp to begin with.

MANDY
That’s right, Josh, and they’ve been waiting for you to trip over your mouth and 
you handed it to them. It’s Christmas morning for Mary Marsh. [pause] You’re a 
Fulbright Scholar, are you honestly the only adult in America who doesn’t think 
you’re about to be fired? Do what Toby’s telling you to do.

JOSH
Did you just call him Lloyd?

MANDY
Who?

JOSH
Senator Russell.

MANDY
When?

JOSH
A minute ago. You said "What do you wanna know? Is-is Lloyd gonna run"?

MANDY
I don’t remember. What does it...?

JOSH
It’s unusual for you that you would call a Senator by his first name to a third party.

MANDY
A third party?

JOSH
You know what I’m saying.

MANDY
No, but as long as one of us does...

JOSH
You’re dating Lloyd Russell.

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
[pause] Wow. That’s great.

MANDY
Are you gonna freak out?

JOSH
No, no, no. Not at all. It’s just -- I always thought he was gay.

MANDY
No you didn’t.

JOSH
I did.

MANDY
He’s not gay.

JOSH
You sure?

MANDY
Very sure.

JOSH
He always seemed effeminate to me.

MANDY
He happens to be very athletic. Plenty masculine.

JOSH
I think he’s a woman.

MANDY
Josh, take me seriously.

JOSH
I do.

MANDY
The New York Times is gonna release a poll in the next few days that brings your 
unfavorables up to 48%.

JOSH
This is the first I’m hearing of it.

MANDY
You’ll have it in about an hour.

JOSH
Where’d you get this?

MANDY
We don’t play for the same team anymore.

JOSH
Wait a minute. One minute you’re giving me career advice, the next minute you’re 
telling me we don’t play for...

MANDY
I’m here for a while. And I want you at your fighting weight when I start 
bitch-slapping you guys around the beltway. [They start to eat.]

JOSH
You and Lloyd Russell, huh?

MANDY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY

LEO 
[on the phone] Seventeen across. Yes. Seventeen across is wrong. You’re spelling 
his name wrong. What’s my name? My name doesn’t matter. I’m just an ordinary citizen 
who relies on the Times crossword for stimulation. And I’m telling you, that I’ve 
met with the man twice, and I’ve recommended a preemptive Exocet Missile attack 
against his airforce. So, I think I know how to...

C.J.
[waves to Margaret and walks in] Leo!

LEO
[he looks at the phone, then hangs up] They hang up on me. Every time.

C.J.
That’s almost hard to believe.

LEO
What do you need?

C.J.
Nightline wants someone for the East Asia...

LEO
Send Naomi. What else?

C.J.
There might be a press leak on A3-C3.

LEO
That was Hutchison. What else?

C.J.
Leo?

LEO
Please don’t ask me about Josh.

C.J.
I was going to ask...

LEO
I honestly don’t know anything.

C.J.
You know the President.

LEO
So do you.

C.J.
You know him better.

LEO
I’ve known him forty years, C.J. And all I can promise you is that on any given day 
there’s really no predicting what he’s going to choose to care about.

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
I’m sorry, I’m late. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Sam is walking along the corridor with his lunch tray, being followed by two 
communications staffers, LARRY and ED.

LARRY
You can’t use those stats.

SAM
The assault stats.

LARRY
The assault stats are wrong.

SAM
We got them from your office.

ED
And we got them from HUD.

SAM
And they’re wrong?

ED
Even if they were right, don’t use ‘em.

SAM
Well, A. Let’s make ‘em right, and B. why can’t I use ‘em?

ED
The 76 year old grandmother.

LARRY
Every time we use those assault stats, Carr and Gilmore come back...

SAM
Who’s the 76 year old--

LARRY
Every day, 17,000 Americans defend themselves with a gun--

SAM
That’s flat-out not true.

ED
--including a 76 year old grandmother in Chicago, who defended herself against an 
intruder in the middle of the night.

LARRY
Just don’t use the stats.

SAM
The 76 year old grandmother doesn’t defend herself with a modified AK-47 Assault 
Rifle, Larry.  Unless she’s defending herself against Turkish rebels. 

Sam’s assistant, CATHY, approaches.

CATHY
Excuse me.

SAM
Oh, you guys know my assistant Cathy?

LARRY
We’ve talked a lot on the phone.

CATHY
Yeah, hi. [to Sam] I need you for just a second.

SAM
Ah, right. [to Ed and Larry] Call me at the end of the day. [walks with Cathy

CATHY
Leo’s wife called.

SAM
That woman hates me.

CATHY
Yes.

SAM
What’d I do?

CATHY
You tried to hit on her at party fundraiser.

SAM
Yes. I meant recently. I meant why did she call.

CATHY
She wants you to...

SAM
For the hundredth time, I didn’t know who she was, and how long am I gonna be 
crucified for that?

CATHY
Well a little while longer anyway, ‘cause...

SAM
Most women, I would think, would be flattered that...

CATHY
Yeah, I think Leo was especially touched that you...

SAM
What’d she want?

CATHY
She was supposed to give a tour to some students from her daughter’s fourth grade 
class. She can’t make it and she wants you to do it.

SAM
I can’t.

They walk in the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

CATHY
You have to. They wrote essays.

SAM
No really, I can’t. I’m not a good tour guide. I don’t know anything about the White 
House. [his pager goes off]

CATHY
You wanna call Mrs. McGarry and tell her that?

SAM
[looking at his pager] Oh God, please let this be a national emergency.

Sam picks up a phone and punches in a number off his pager. A woman answers.

WOMAN [VO]
Cashmere Escorts.

SAM 
[on the phone] Hi. You paged me?

WOMAN [VO]
Who is this?

SAM 
[on the phone] This is Sam Seaborn.

WOMAN [VO]
I’m sorry. There’s been a mistake.

SAM 
[on the phone] Who’s this?

WOMAN [VO]
Cashmere Escort Service.

SAM 
[on the phone, confused] Okey-doke. [hangs up, to Cathy] Page me.

CATHY
Where are you going?

SAM
I’m standing right here. Page me and punch in my number.

Cathy does. Sam watches his pager. Nothing.

CATHY
You switched pagers with someone.

SAM
A woman’s about to call me. She’s not gonna know why. Put her through. [goes into 
his office and closes the door. He shuts the door and sits at his desk, waiting for 
the phone to ring, which it soon does]Hello?

LAURIE [VO]
Hello? You paged me?

SAM 
[on the phone] Laurie?

LAURIE [VO]
Who’s this?

SAM 
[on the phone] It’s Sam.

LAURIE [VO]
Hi.

SAM 
[on the phone] Sam Seaborn.

LAURIE [VO]
Yeah. You called me.

SAM 
[on the phone] Yeah, ah, actually you called me. And that’s because you have my 
pager. And I have yours. 

LAURIE [VO]
Oh.

SAM 
[on the phone] Yeah. Look, listen, can I come by and see you real quick?

LAURIE [VO]
Yeah.

SAM 
[on the phone] Thanks... Good... Okay.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
A few reporters are waiting around for C.J., who enters the hallway. Billy is 
talking to another reporter.

BILLY
I’m holding four column inches above the fold.

REPORTER
You’re going to be wrong.

BILLY
I’ve got Al Caldwell, Mary Marsh...

C.J.
Guys, I don’t have a lot of time to answer questions right now.

CHRIS
C.J., has--

C.J.
But that shouldn’t stop you from asking them anyway. Chris?

CHRIS
Has the President had any reaction to Josh on the show?

C.J.
None that I’m aware of.

CHRIS
Do you know--

C.J.
Seriously, that’s it. I’ll get you wheels down time when I’ve got it. [continues to 
wall through the hallway and is intercepted by Toby]

TOBY
They’re picking up the scent.

C.J.
Billy is. The rest of ‘em are picking up Billy’s scent.

TOBY
Josh is gonna come to the coffee.

C.J.
Keep him cool.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Leo and AL CALDWELL are walking and are in the middle of a conversation.

LEO
President’s a deeply religious man, Reverend. I don’t need to tell you that.

CALDWELL
No.

LEO
He’s worked with the Southern Baptist Leadership Conference. He’s worked with 
the Catholic Relief...

CALDWELL
He’s spoken at my church.

LEO
Yes, he has. He also spent eight months traveling around the country discouraging 
young women from having abortions.

CALDWELL
Oh, hang on. He never said anything...

LEO
He doesn’t believe that it’s the government’s place to legislate this issue. But 
that has not stopped him from playing his role as a moral leader. Something which 
cost him dearly in the campaign and you know that.

CALDWELL
Why does he insist on demonizing us as a group?

LEO
Because your group has plenty of demons.

CALDWELL
[snorts] Every group has plenty of demons.

LEO
You don’t have to tell me about it, Reverend. I’m a member of the Democratic Party.

CALDWELL
Why does the White House suddenly talk like everyone in the Christian Right is the 
same?

LEO
Forgive me, Al. But when you stand that close to Mary Marsh and John Van Dyke, it’s 
sometimes hard not to paint you all with the same brush.

CALDWELL
We need John and Mary for political muscle.

LEO
I don’t think you do, but I recognize you’re in a tough spot.

CALDWELL
I’m not looking for a holy war, Leo.

LEO
Oh, I know you’re not, Al. And I think that you and I can keep this from escalating 
beyond the petulant woman being angry about getting her hair a little messed up on T.V.

CALDWELL
And there you go again. [They stop walking to face one another.]

LEO
What?

CALDWELL
It was not a little deal.

LEO
No one’s saying...

CALDWELL
And I want to make sure -- of nothing else, I want to make sure that you’re taking 
me seriously.

LEO
You don’t think we’re taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President ordered 
me to fire Josh Lyman. I’ve been trying to talk him down from it ever since. He’s 
getting off the plane in ten minutes. It’s 6 to 5 at pickin’ whether Josh still 
has a job. Now, I don’t know how much more seriously we can take it.

CALDWELL
Well, that’s regrettable.

LEO
Yes, it is. [They start walking again.] Anyway, I’m glad Toby organized your meeting 
this afternoon.

CALDWELL
So am I.

CUT TO: INT. LAURIE’S APARTMENT - DAY
Laurie, in jeans in a sweatshirt, answers the knocking at the door. Sam is standing 
there in his overcoat.

SAM
Hi.

LAURIE
Hi.

SAM
Can I come in?

LAURIE
Sure. [lets Sam in]

SAM
[walks down the long hallway in her apartment] This is a nice apartment.

LAURIE
You saw it last night.

SAM
Yeah, and I really like it.

LAURIE
Thanks.

SAM
It makes very good use of space.

LAURIE
[grabbing the pager off her couch] Thanks.

SAM
The way the ladle hangs from the pegboard.

LAURIE
The ladle didn’t actually come with the apartment. It’s mine.

SAM
Right.

LAURIE
Yeah.

SAM
Um, can I ask you something?

LAURIE
Am I a hooker?

SAM
No. No. What I was gonna say is this: Is it possible, that in addition to being a 
law student and part-time bartender, that you are what I’m certain would have to be 
a very high-priced call girl. I, by the way, making no judgments. The thing is, 
with my job--

LAURIE
Yes.

SAM
Yes?

LAURIE
Yeah, I’m sorry. I should’ve told you. I wanted you to like me.

SAM
I do. I gotta go. [waits a moment then walks to the door]

LAURIE
Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

LAURIE
My pager.

SAM
Oh, right. [exchanges pagers]

LAURIE
Thanks.

SAM
Listen, I don’t know how often you get up...

LAURIE
Sam. Go. You don’t know who I am.

SAM
It’s just that there are people who’d pay a lot of money for...

LAURIE
I know. Go. It’s okay.

Sam turns and goes.

CUT TO: INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
A group of visitors, AL CALDWELL, MARY MARSH, JOHN VAN DYKE and several of their 
assistants and staff people are following C.J.’s assistant, CAROL, who leads them 
to a room.

CAROL
Reverend Caldwell, if you all would just step in here.

The group goes into the mural room as Cathy passes by and looks into the 
ROOSEVELT ROOM. Several nine-year-olds are waiting patiently with their teacher, 
MALLORY O’BRIAN. Cathy opens the door to address them.

CATHY
Excuse me. Hi. We’re going to be just a minute so why doesn’t everyone have a seat.
[leaves] 

MALLORY
[to the children] All right. Everybody, nicely and quietly, take a seat.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Donna is standing in front of Josh, holding out a fresh shirt and tie.

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Put it on.

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Put it on.

JOSH
No.

DONNA
You’ve been wearing the same clothes for 31 hours now, Josh.

JOSH [OS]
I am not getting spruced up for these people, Donna.

DONNA
All the girls think you look really hot in this shirt.

Josh grabs the shirt and tie. Donna walks out of the office into the corridor.

DONNA
[calling out] Bonnie!

BONNIE [OS]
Yeah?

DONNA
Tell Toby he’s changing his shirt.

BONNIE
Right.

We move to the LOBBY where Cathy meets Sam as he enters.

CATHY
You’re late.

SAM
I’m having kind of a weird day. [They begin walking.]

CATHY
Leo’s daughter’s class is waiting with their teacher and a couple of parents in 
the Roosevelt Room.

SAM
I don’t know what to say to them.

CATHY
You’re supposed to tell them about the building and its history. Do you need anything?

SAM
I need someone to tell me about the building and its history.

CATHY
Just fake it.

SAM
I can’t fake it.

CATHY
Of course you can fake it.

THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Fifteen or so fourth-graders, dressed in their White House best, 
are sitting patiently along with their teacher, Mallory. Sam and Cathy pull around 
the corner and stop outside the door.

SAM
Which one is Leo’s daughter?

CATHY
What does it matter?

SAM
I want to make a good impression. What does she look like?

CATHY
I don’t know.

SAM
Okay. I just want to thank you for all of your help. 

CATHY
Sure.

Sam tries to open one of the doors, but finds it locked. Cathy opens the other 
door for him.

SAM
Hi, I’m sorry to be late.

MALLORY
Mr. Seaborn. Mallory O’Brian.

SAM
Hi.

MALLORY
And these are the fourth graders at Clearlake Elementary School who wrote the best 
essays on why they wanted to visit the White House.

SAM
Well, that’s just great, why don’t we get started. [walks around the table] My name 
is Sam Seaborn and I’m the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean 
exactly? Well, to begin with, I’m a counselor to the President, mostly on domestic 
matters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the 
Communications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our 
message and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my 
functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it’s important to 
remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay my salary. 
So I work for you whether you voted for us or not.

There’s an awkward silence in the room before--

MALLORY
Mr. Seaborn, maybe you could give us some history.

SAM
Sure. I graduated law school eight years ago and started working for 
Dewey-Ballantine where I--

MALLORY
Actually, I’m sorry to interrupt, actually I meant a history of the building.

SAM
The White House.

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
Sure. [pause] The White House, as you know, was built several years ago. Mostly, if 
I’m not mistaken, out of cement. The room we’re in right now, the Roosevelt Room, 
is very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The 
chairs that you’re sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a pirate ship 
captured during the Spanish-American--

The students are enraptured, but Mallory becomes upset.

MALLORY
[stands] All right. Kids, I need to speak with Mr. Seaborn. Sit tight for a second.

Sam follows Mallory into the HALLWAY.

MALLORY
Hi.

SAM
How ya doin’?

MALLORY
I’m sorry to be rude, but are you a moron?

SAM
In this particular area, yes.

MALLORY
The 18th President was Ulysses S. Grant, and the Roosevelt Room was named for Theodore.

SAM
Really?

MALLORY
There’s like a six-foot painting on the wall of Teddy Roosevelt.

SAM
I should’ve put two and two together.

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
Look, the thing is, while there are really a great many things I can speak with 
authority, I’m not good at talking about the White House.

MALLORY
You’re the White House Deputy Communications Director and you’re not good at talking 
about the White House?

SAM
Ironic, isn’t it?

MALLORY
I don’t believe this. [starts to go back into the room, but Sam stops her]

SAM
Wait a minute. Wait. Please. Could you do me favor? Could you tell me which one of 
those kids is Leo McGarry’s daughter?

MALLORY
Why?

SAM
Well, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, just see that 
she has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier.

MALLORY
These children worked hard. All of them. And I’m not inclined at this moment to make 
your life easier.

SAM
Ms. O’Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that 
I’m a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll 
that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House has lost 
energy and focus. A perception that’s not likely to be altered by the video footage 
of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard are 
fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to 
blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine’s about to get fired for going on 
television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute 
last night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which one of 
those kids is my boss’s daughter.

MALLORY
That would be me.

SAM
You.

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
Leo’s daughter’s fourth grade class.

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
[pause] Well, this is bad on so many levels.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Josh, C.J., Toby, Donna and a few aides walk through the corridors toward the 
MURAL ROOM.

C.J.
She’s gonna try and bait you, Josh, you understand what I’m saying?

JOSH
Lloyd Russell. Yeah, that’ll last.

C.J.
Are you listening to me?

JOSH
[repeating] They’re gonna try and bait me.

C.J.
They want you to say something arrogant.

JOSH
I don’t need baiting for that.

They walk into the MURAL ROOM where Al Caldwell, Mary Marsh, John Van Dyke, and 
several staffers are waiting.

TOBY
Hi. Hi, good afternoon. We apologize. We’re running a bit behind today.

Josh sits quietly, as C.J. and Toby greet everyone.

CALDWELL
That’s quite all right. How’s the President’s health.

C.J.
It’s a mild sprain, he’ll be fine.

CALDWELL
Good, good. You all know Mary Marsh and John Van Dyke.

C.J.
Yes.

TOBY
Everybody, sit, sit, sit. We’re happy you all could come talk with us today. As 
you know, the President makes a usual Sunday morning radio address, and in a few 
weeks we’ve scheduled--

CALDWELL
Ah, Toby, if I may interrupt for just a momentŠ the goals and spirit of Christian 
and Family oriented organizations, while embraced by a great and growing number of 
Americans, have been met with hostility and contempt by their Government. Now, 
yesterday morning, on the television program Capital Beat, that contempt was given 
a voice... and a face... and a name. [to Josh] I’m referring, of course, to you, sir.

JOSH
Yes, I know, and I’m glad you brought that up...

CALDWELL
I was surprised at you, Josh. I always counted you as a friend.

JOSH
And I’m honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the 
program yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration. 
That’s important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks were glib
 and insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to step up and 
debate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize.

MARY 
[pause, then turns to Toby] Good then. Let’s deal.

TOBY
[beat] I’m sorry?

MARY 
What do we get?

TOBY
For what?

MARY 
For insulting millions of Americans.

TOBY
Well, like Josh said...

MARY 
I heard what Josh said, Toby, what do we get?

TOBY
An apology.

MARY 
Sunday morning radio address. Public morals. School prayer or pornography, take 
your pick.

TOBY
School prayer or pornography?

VAN DYKE
It’s on every street corner.

TOBY
I’ve seen it. Mary...

MARY 
Condoms in the schools.

TOBY
What?!

MARY 
Condoms in the schools.

TOBY
Well, that’s a problem.

MARY 
What?

TOBY
[raising his voice] We have a Surgeon General who says they dramatically reduce the 
risk of teen pregnancy and AIDS.

MARY 
So does abstinence.

VAN DYKE
Show the average American teenage male a condom and his mind will turn to thoughts 
of lust.

TOBY
Show the average American teenage male a lug wrench and his mind’ll turn...

C.J.
Toby!

MARY 
School prayer, pornography, condoms. What’s it gonna be?

TOBY
We’re not prepared to make any sort of deal right now.

JOSH
Sure we are. Mary...

MARY 
[to Josh] My read of the landscape is that you’re cleaning out your desk before the 
end of business today, so I’d just as soon negotiate with Toby if it’s all the same 
to you.

CALDWELL
Mary.

MARY 
[to Caldwell] Please allow me to work. [to Josh] It was only a matter of time with 
you, Josh. 

JOSH
Yes.

MARY 
That New York sense of humor was just a...

CALDWELL
Mary, there no need...

MARY 
Reverend, please! They think they’re so much smarter. They think it’s smart talk. 
But nobody else does.

JOSH
I’m actually from Connecticut, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is, Mary...

TOBY
She meant Jewish. [A stunned silence. Everyone stares at Toby.] When she said "New 
York sense of humor", she was talking about you and me.

JOSH
You know what, Toby, let’s just not even go there.

CALDWELL
There’s been an apology. Let’s move on.

VAN DYKE
I’d like to discuss why we hear so much talk about the First Amendment coming out 
of this building, but no talk at all about the First Commandment.

MARY 
I don’t like what I’ve just been accused of.

TOBY
[raising his voice] I’m afraid that’s just tough, Mrs. Marsh.

VAN DYKE
The First Commandment says "Honor thy Father".

TOBY
No it doesn’t.

JOSH
Toby--

TOBY
It doesn’t.

JOSH
Listen--

TOBY
No, if I’m gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we’re gonna get 
the names of the damn commandments right.

MARY 
Okay. Here we go.

TOBY
"Honor thy Father" is the Third Commandment.

VAN DYKE
Then what’s the First Commandment?

A booming voice comes from off screen. The camera moves to show PRESIDENT JED BARTLET 
with a cane standing in the doorway with several Secret Service agents.

PRESIDENT JED BARTLET
"I am the Lord your God. Thou shalt worship no other God before me." 
Boy, those were the days, huh?

Everyone stands.

CALDWELL
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Al. What do we got here, C.J.?

C.J.
Well, we’ve got some hot tempers, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Mary.

JOHN VAN DYKE
Mr. President, I’m John Van Dyke.

BARTLET
Yes. Reverend?

VAN DYKE
May I ask you a question, sir?

BARTLET
Of course.

VAN DYKE
If our children can buy pornography on any street corner for five dollars, isn’t 
that too high a price to pay for free speech?

BARTLET
No.

VAN DYKE
Really?

BARTLET
On the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for 
pornography.

C.J.
Why don’t we all sit down?

BARTLET
No. Let’s not, C.J. These people won’t be staying that long. May I have some coffee, 
Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe 
group that calls itself The Lambs of God?

CALDWELL
Sir, it’s not up to me to...

BARTLET
Crap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do 
anything while I’m upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 28 
years ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I’m 
going out for a drive. I get in the station wagon, and put it in reverse, and pull 
out of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and quietly enter 
into the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door.

Bartlet pauses to take a drink of his coffee and smile at Josh, who smiles back 
uncomfortably.

BARTLET [cont.]
Abbey told me to not drive while I was upset and she was right. She was right 
yesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was upset, but 
I did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I’ve ever been in my life. 
It seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the teen magazines. 
And somewhere between movie stars and make-up tips, she talked about her feelings on 
a woman’s right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious, but she’s 
got a good head on her shoulders and I like it when she uses it, so I couldn’t 
understand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, "Elizabeth, 
what’s wrong?" She said, "It’s Annie." Now I love my family and I’ve read my bible 
from cover to cover so I want you to tell me, from what part of the Holy Scripture 
do you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent my 12 
year-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its throat?
[pause] You’ll denounce these people, Al. You’ll do it publicly. And until you do, 
you can all get your fat asses out of my White House. [Everyone is frozen.] 
C.J., show these people out.

MARY MARSH
I believe we can find the door.

BARTLET
Find it now.

The group leaves the room quickly and quietly.

CALDWELL
[quietly to Leo] We’ll fix this, Leo.

LEO
See that you do.

Bartlet has gone out the side door, through an adjoining room and into THE OVAL OFFICE. 
The staff begins recovering from this last moment and following the President.

JOSH
Okay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in the room?

TOBY
Hey...

C.J.
Way to stay cool.

TOBY
I am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights.

JOSH
I thought you were going to take a swing at her there.

TOBY
She was calling us New York Jews, Josh.

JOSH
Yeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn’t mind so much. [They enter the Oval Office.]
You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where 
you said nothing at all.

C.J.
I’m sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was Lloyd Russell 
and your girlfriend.

SAM
Mandy and Lloyd Russell?

JOSH
I’ll be puttin’ an end to that.

BARTLET
"Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How’s the ankle, sir?" 
Seems to me we’ve all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives 
or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It’s not a bad idea taking a 
break every now and then. I know how hard you all work.

MARGARET, Leo’s secretary, brings Leo a note, which he slips to Bartlet after 
reading it. 

BARTLET
[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me with this 
press clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited 
because this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the inside flesh 
of this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians commented that 
they thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she thought it 
was a very impressive tomato. I don’t know what made me think of that.
[reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports 
approximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700 turned back 
due to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have been taken 
into custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their 
backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn’t die want a better life. 
And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break’s over.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

The senior staff say their thanks and begin to leave the office. Josh is the last 
to the door.

BARTLET
Josh. "Too busy being indicted for tax fraud"? [beat] Don’t ever do it again.

JOSH
[quietly] Yes sir. [exits]

BARTLET
[calls] Mrs. Landingham. What’s next?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Governor Thomas and the Majority Leader have asked to be conferenced in and the 
group from NASA is assembling for their photo-op. At seven o’clock, you have...

Mrs. Landingham continues as the camera moves and shows us an overhead shot of the 
Presidential Seal and the Oval Office.

Episode 1.1 -- “Pilot”
Original Airdate: September 22, 1999, 9;00 EST

West Wing S01E02
Despite warnings from fellow office workers, infatuated White House staffer Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) presses his luck when he continues to publicly pursue a high-priced call girl (Lisa Edelstein) with whom he shared a night of passion. Press secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) tries to defuse a potentially nasty public clash between the President (Martin Sheen) and his willful Vice President (Tim Matheson) concerning the Veep's quotes about a bill favored by the chief executive. Exasperated political consultant Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) drowns her troubles when her only client, Senator Lloyd Russell (John Bedford Lloyd) ignores her advice and agrees to bottle up a key bill in committee that could have been costly for the President if put to a vote. The President forges a kinship with a young African-American Navy captain, Morris Tolliver (Reuben Santiago-Hudson) who's substituting for his regular White House physician - so much, in fact, that he asks him to assume the position on a full-time basis.

TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - DAY
Music is playing from Mandy’s B.M.W. convertible as she drives down the street. 
As she stops for the red light, she sees three people across the street near 
the Capitol Building. She honks the car’s horn several times. Senator LLOYD 
RUSSELL is one of the three men. He looks at the car and shakes his head. As 
the traffic light turns green, Mandy drives fast across the street, through 
and against the curb, and leaves her car there.

MANDY
[yells] Are you crazy?!

She jumps out of her convertible without opening the door. She rushes toward 
Russell, who is with two men from his staff.

MANDY
Are you crazy?!

RUSSELL
Mandy.

MANDY
Have you lost your mind?

RUSSELL
Why don’t we go to my office, we can talk about it...

MANDY
Why did you make that deal?

STAFFER 1
Lady, I don’t think you can leave your car right there...

MANDY
Shut up! [to Lloyd] Why did you make that deal?

RUSSELL
It’s just until after the midterms, Mandy.

MANDY
Lloyd?

STAFFER 2
We keep the bill in committee until after the midterms, and that way...

MANDY
And that way, the White House doesn’t have to veto it until nobody’s looking.

RUSSELL
Well...

MANDY
We wanted people to be looking!

STAFFER 1
[to Lloyd] Senator, we really should be moving along here.

MANDY
Lloyd, what? Why? Why did you go to breakfast to make that deal?

STAFFER 1
They offered us a good spot at the nominating convention.

MANDY
Excuse me?

RUSSELL
That’s true. I might nominate the President.

STAFFER 2
Possibly keynote.

RUSSELL
Definitely something in primetime.

MANDY
Of course, they offered you something good at the nominating convention. They 
don’t want you to get nominated at the nominating convention!

RUSSELL
Settle down.

MANDY
That bill was our coming out party. We were gonna have the stage for a month! 
It was our Nesun Dorma!

STAFFER 1
What the hell’s Nesun Dorma?

STAFFER 2
It’s an Italian aria by Wagner...

MANDY
It’s Puccini. Wagner’s German, and you’re a moron.

MAN
[approaches] Excuse me, ma’am. Is everything all right?

MANDY
No, everything is not all right! I left a job at a top-tier marketing firm 
where I had stock options. I come down here and get this guy elected President. 
But he went to breakfast this morning, and made a deal at 443 until after the 
midterm elections. Avoiding the national exposure that was our ONLY HOPE of 
making any kind of a challenge! [The man has left already.]

STAFFER 1
Senator, we’ve got a caucus.

RUSSELL
Hang on. [Mandy and Russell walk away from other two guys.]

MANDY
Lloyd?

RUSSELL
Listen to me.

MANDY
I was going...

RUSSELL
Listen to me… It wasn’t gonna happen. Maybe somewhere down the road. But this 
year, it wasn’t gonna happen.

MANDY
I had two years to make it happen. I was gonna take them on! They beat me 
before I got my boxes unpacked.

RUSSELL
You’ll bounce back. You’ve got spunk.

MANDY
[quickly takes off her shoe] I could kill you with my shoe!

RUSSELL
Mandy! Mandy! Mandy! It wasn’t gonna happen.

MANDY
You know what the worst part about this is?

RUSSELL
[looks at the car] Well, I think you dinged up your suspension pretty good.

MANDY
No, Lloyd. It’s the party they’re having right now in the West Wing at my 
expense.

RUSSELL
They’re not having a party in the West Wing.

MANDY
I worked with these people for two and a half years. They like to win and then 
they like to gloat.

RUSSELL
I’m sure you’re wrong.

MANDY
I’m sure I’m not.

RUSSELL
There are very serious men and women in the White House. A blow was struck for 
party unity this morning. There’s no cause to gloat.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

JOSH
[comes out of his office] Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the 
morning people. Victory is mine!

DONNA
Good morning, Josh.

JOSH
I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in 
all the land.

DONNA
It’s gonna be an unbearable day.

Donna hangs her jacket. Josh throws up his arms in victory in front of the other 
staffers, who are clapping for him.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Toby comes out of his office and heads out. C.J. follows.

TOBY
I don’t understand.

C.J.
They refused.

TOBY
How did they refuse?

C.J.
They turned down. They declined the invitation.

TOBY
How does someone decline an invitation for a photo-op with the President?

C.J.
I’m saying this is the kind of luck we’re having.

TOBY
Because of the joke?

C.J.
Because of the joke.

STAFFER
[passes by] Good morning.

TOBY
Good morning.

C.J.
Who’s that?

TOBY
Who cares? We need somebody.

C.J.
You try getting his attention on this.

OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Mrs. Landingham is behind her desk. Toby approaches.

TOBY
Mrs. Landingham, does the President have free time this morning?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President has nothing but free time, Toby. Right now he’s in the residence 
eating Cheerios and enjoying Regis and Kathie Lee. Should I get him for you?

TOBY
Sarcasm’s a disturbing thing coming from a woman of your age, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What age would that be, Toby?

TOBY
Late twenties?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Atta boy.

TOBY
[opens the cookie jar] Can I have a cookie?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
No.

SAM
[walks in] Toby, they turned down our request?

TOBY
C.J.’s on it.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning, Sam.

SAM
Good morning.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Have a cookie, Sam.

SAM
Thank you. [takes a cookie]

Toby, still holding the cookie jar lid, looks at Mrs. Landingham. She looks back.

C.J.
They’re issuing a press release. We’re gonna be playing defense all day.

SAM
[mouthful] Is this really because of the joke?

C.J.
It’s because of the joke.

Josh steps in. Donna stays at the door.

JOSH
Someone give me a river to forge, a serpent to slay.

C.J.
[to Donna] What’s his problem?

DONNA
He’s been drinking from the keg of glory. We’re to bring him all the muffins 
and bagels in the land.

TOBY
We heard. 

SAM
Good job.

JOSH
Thank you very much. C.J., they turned down the invitation?

C.J.
They declined.

The staff walks into THE OVAL OFFICE.

JOSH
What does that mean?

C.J.
It means they turned down the invitation.

JOSH
Because of the joke?

C.J.
Of course, because of the joke. Why does everyone keep asking? As if it could 
be something...

Josh and C.J. pass through as Bartlet and Leo come in from the portico.

LEO
...32 billion against the trade surplus.

BARTLET
That’s no good. Jaworski knows that’s no good.

LEO
Mostly, he’s gonna say that the Japanese need to buy more American cars.

BARTLET
Americans need to buy more American cars.

LEO
Which is what I told Jaworski.

BARTLET
Good morning everyone.

ALL
Good morning.

BARTLET
What do you got?

JOSH
443’s gonna stay in committee.

BARTLET
I heard.

LEO
What else?

C.J.
The Ryder Cup team is declining our invitation to come to the White House.

LEO
You’re kidding.

C.J.
Because of the joke.

BARTLET
You’re kidding.

C.J.
I’m not.

Mrs. Landingham comes in and gives Bartlet his schedule.

BARTLET
The Ryder Cup team?

C.J.
It’s a group of the best golfers in the country...

BARTLET
I know what the Ryder Cup team is. Thanks Mrs. Landingham.

C.J.
Sir, this may be a good time to talk about your sense of humor.

BARTLET
[looks at his schedule] I’ve got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing, 
and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure 
this is a good time to talk about my sense of humor?

C.J.
No.

BARTLET
Me neither.

LEO
What else?

C.J.
It’s just that it’s not the first time it’s happened.

BARTLET
I know.

TOBY
She’s talking about Texas, sir.

BARTLET
I know.

C.J.
U.S.A. Today asks you why you don’t spend more time campaigning in Texas and 
you say it’s ‘cause you don’t look good in funny hats.

SAM
It was “big hats.”

C.J.
What difference does it make?

BARTLET
It makes a difference.

C.J.
The point is we got whomped in Texas.

JOSH
We got whomped in Texas twice.

C.J.
We got whomped in the primary, and we got whomped in November.

BARTLET
I think I was there.

C.J.
And it was avoidable, sir.

BARTLET
C.J., on your tombstone, it’s gonna read, “Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.”

C.J.
Okay, but none of my visitors are going to be able to understand my tombstone.

BARTLET
Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know “post hoc, ergo propter hoc?” 
Josh?

JOSH
Uh, uh, post, after, after hoc, ergo, therefore, after hoc, therefore, 
something else hoc.

BARTLET
Thank you. Next?

JOSH
Uh, if I’d gotten more credit on the 443...

BARTLET
Leo?

LEO
After it, therefore because of it. [Josh, a little weirded out, looks]

BARTLET
After it, therefore because of it. It means one thing follows the other, 
therefore it was caused by the other, but it’s not always true. In fact, it’s 
hardly ever true. We did not lose Texas because of the hat joke. Do you know 
when we lost Texas?

C.J.
When you learned to speak Latin?

BARTLET
Go figure.

LEO
What else?

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
CAPTAIN MORRIS TOLLIVER, the President’s physician, comes in. NANCY greets him.

NANCY
Captain Tolliver, can I get you a cup of coffee?

MORRIS
No, I’m fine, Nancy. Thank you.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning, Morris. It’s good to see you.

MORRIS
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
He’s a little backed up this morning.

MORRIS
I can see that.

The door to the Oval Office opens. Leo, Sam, Josh, and other staffers come out.

LEO
Sam, when are you writing the Hilton Head draft?

SAM
I’m closing my door from noon to three.

JOSH
Let me see it at three.

SAM
Yeah.

LEO
Morris.

MORRIS
Good morning.

LEO
Stan, I’ll be just a second. [to Morris] Take a walk with me, will you?

MORRIS
Sure. [They walk.]

LEO
You look well.

MORRIS
Well, I’m feeling pretty good.

LEO
How’s the baby?

MORRIS
Ten days old today.

LEO
You got a picture?

MORRIS
Well, I don’t know... Let me see... Well, what do you know? [fishes out a 
picture]

LEO
Oh, she’s a knockout.

MORRIS
Both of them.

LEO
I’m sorry. I’ve forgotten your wife’s name.

MORRIS
Angela.

LEO
And the girl?

MORRIS
Corey.

Margaret comes from behind as they enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Leo and 
Morris stop walking.

MARGARET
Leo, did you tell the council’s office that they would be in on the ten 
o’clock?

LEO
I may have.

MARGARET
That’s really something that you want to tell me.

LEO
[hands her the picture] Here. It’s a baby and a new mother. Look at that for a 
minute.

MARGARET
Oh!

Leo and Morris walk again. Margaret follows while looking at the picture.

LEO
Listen, quickly. I know you were just supposed to be filling in till Terry 
Wyatt came back, but the President likes you, and he’d like to keep you on if 
you don’t have any objections.

MORRIS
I don’t have any objections.

LEO
Good.

MORRIS
But I don’t have to be covered next week. I’m leaving the country in a few 
hours.

LEO
Where are you going?

MORRIS
Jordan.

LEO
For how long?

MORRIS
For just a week.

LEO
Then you’ll start the week after.

MORRIS
Leo?

LEO
Yeah?

MORRIS
I’m comparatively low-ranked.

LEO
He likes you, Morris. He feels better after he’s talked to you. I think there 
have been days when you’ve lightened the load a little.

MORRIS
It’s not the big load, I’m just...

LEO
He likes you, Morris. I got to get back in the Oval. [to Margaret] Give him his 
picture.

Leo walks off. Margaret gives Morris back his picture and follows Leo.

CUT TO: EXT. MANDY’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY
Mandy's convertible is being towed outside. Inside, Mandy walks in. She finds 
her assistant, DAISY, inside.

DAISY
Hey.

MANDY
Hey.

DAISY
88-B’s straightened out, and Chris Matthews wants to know what we know.

MANDY
Well, I have some news.

DAISY
Good news?

MANDY
Well, there’s a way to see it as bad news, but I think it’s good news.

DAISY
What is it?

MANDY
Lloyd Russell is no longer our client.

DAISY
Really?

MANDY
Yes.

DAISY
Lloyd Russell is our only client.

MANDY
Was.

DAISY
What happened? This is a total disaster!

MANDY
Look, if that’s the spin you’re gonna put on it...

DAISY
Mandy...

MANDY
He wants to work with the President on 443.

DAISY
He’s not gonna run?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
You lost our only client?

MANDY
I’d like to think of us as a team, Daisy.

DAISY
I quit my job!

MANDY
So did I.

DAISY
After putting about a half a million dollars in the bank.

MANDY
I saved wisely.

DAISY
How are you gonna pay me?

MANDY
Can I just say that it so typically you to leap that question at a time like 
this?

DAISY
It’s not typically me, Mandy. It’s typically my landlord. It’s typically 
college loans. It’s typically the guy who’s gonna sell me a carton of milk 
next week.

MANDY
You’re not the only one with expenses, Daisy. I’ve got credit cards, and I’ve 
got condo payments, plus I think I may have dinged up the suspension on my BMW.

DAISY
What are we gonna do?

MANDY
I’m formulating a plan.

Mandy walks inside a bathroom and closes the door.

CUT TO: INT. THE WEST WING - HALLWAY - DAY
Donna finds Josh. They walk.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
What do you need?

DONNA
You owe me a hundred dollars.

JOSH
For what?

DONNA
I entered you in a college football pool.

JOSH
Without telling me?

DONNA
Well, it’s kind of a surprise.

JOSH
How did I do?

DONNA
You lost a hundred dollars.

JOSH
On who?

DONNA
On Central Indiana State.

JOSH
What was the line?

DONNA
It wasn’t really that kind of a pool.

JOSH
What kind of a pool was it?

DONNA
You just pick the winner.

JOSH
You picked Central Indiana State?

DONNA
The Fighting Okies.

JOSH
Who are they playing?

DONNA
Notre Dame.

JOSH
You picked Central Indiana State against Notre Dame?

DONNA
Well, technically, you did.

Toby passes them. Josh calls him as Donna walks off. We follow Toby and Josh.

JOSH
Toby!

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
We need to do something.

TOBY
Ryder Cup team.

JOSH
The Ryder Cup is just the latest in a string.

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
The banking committee...

TOBY
New Jersey, G-8.

JOSH
Bicycle under the tree?

TOBY
Yes, though I’m not sure what our new media director would have done about that.

JOSH
Me neither, but we need a new media director. I’d been on talent shows with 
more polish than some of the events around here.

TOBY
On talent shows?

JOSH
As a kid. Listen...

TOBY
On what if?

JOSH
We need to double-team him.

TOBY
If we bring Sam and C.J. too.

JOSH
We need to gang up on.

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
We do it as a gang.

TOBY
See you later.

Josh stops walking as Toby continues down the hall.

JOSH
Listen, it’s not gonna be Mandy, right?

TOBY
Nope.

JOSH
Anyone but Mandy.

Toby had walked near C.J.’s Office. He sees C.J. as they head off.

C.J.
“Post hoc ergo propter hoc”? I’ll bet that used to have them rolling in the 
aisles at the Whiffinpoof Dinners.

TOBY
Fly in the teeth with it.

C.J.
You think?

TOBY
Be funny. You’re at your best with a pie in the face.

C.J.
I’ve been told that.

TOBY
In fact, I’d hold back. Keep it in your back pocket.

C.J.
Janet?

TOBY
If you don’t like the rhythm of the “Q” and “A,” use the Ryder Cup. Just fly in 
the teeth with it.

C.J.
Yeah.

C.J. and Toby walk off. The staffer JANET speaks into the P.A.

JANET
[into P.A.] Please take your seats. Please take your seats, folks. We’re gonna 
start the briefing. 

PRESS BRIEFING ROOM. C.J. and Toby walk in. We continue to hear Janet from the 
P.A. while C.J. walks toward the podium as the reporters take their seats.

JANET [P.A.]
Please take your seats. Please take your seats, folks.

C.J.
Good morning. We got a birthday today, right? Suzanne?

SUZANNE
Bobbi.

C.J.
It’s Bobbi’s birthday!

BOBBI
Yes, it is.

MIKE
C.J.? Uh, a short while ago the Vice President commented on the White House’s 
position on the A3-C3 saying, and I’m quoting from notes, “This is the time 
when the President needs our support.” Can you clarify the language?

C.J.
No. I can’t, Mike. I haven’t spoken with the Vice President today.

MIKE
The language seemed strained, doesn’t it?

C.J. 
[glances at Toby, then back at Mike] Strange?

MIKE
Strained. “This is the time when the President needs our support.”

C.J.
It sounds pretty straightforward. I’ll tell you what though, if you consult the 
morning releases, you’ll see that in the world of sports, the White House just 
got dissed by 12 guys named Flippy.

Laughter. C.J. looks at Toby, who is smiling at her response. We zoom out of 
the PRESS ROOM.

C.J.
Who’s got questions?

REPORTER
C.J., does this have anything to do with the joke, and is the President 
planning on making an apology?

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Josh is watching C.J.’s briefing from a nearby television. Sam comes up.

C.J. 
[on T.V.] I have to say that it came as a bit of a surprise to discover that 
professional golfers don’t have a sense of humor, especially after seeing them 
in some of the outfits.

SAM
Hey.

JOSH
Hey.

SAM
What’s up?

C.J.
[on T.V.] Thank you...

JOSH 
[starts walking with Sam] C.J. just discovered that Hoynes, when responding to 
a question on A3, said “this is the time when the President needs our support.” 
Third one in five weeks.

SAM
So she moved on to the Ryder Cup?

JOSH
Wouldn’t you?

SAM
Yeah. [beat] Listen, make sure C.J. keeps this off Leo’s desk.

JOSH
I think it goes right on Leo’s desk.

SAM
A vague quote from Hoynes will disappear by the end of the next news cycle. 
A fistfight between Leo and the Vice President’s got juice.

JOSH
Fair point.

SAM
Talk to C.J.

JOSH
Yeah. I will.

One he gets his coffee, Josh walks away. After a while he notices that Sam is 
following him.

JOSH
Did you need me?

SAM
I’m sorry?

JOSH
Didn’t you come to see me?

SAM
I was just stretching my legs.

JOSH
Oh.

They walk into JOSH’S OFFICE.

SAM
I’m supposed to be working on the Hilton Head draft right now, and I am, but 
I’m just stretching my legs.

JOSH
Okay.

SAM
Last week, I was out for a late drink, and I met this woman named Laurie, and 
Laurie and I hit it off, and we spent the evening together back at her place, 
and the next day I discovered she was a call girl.

Josh has been drinking his coffee. He's having a hard time swallowing.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

JOSH
Do you want to maybe close the door?

SAM
Yeah. [he does] 

JOSH
You slept with a call girl?

SAM
Well no, I... well, yes. Yes I did.

JOSH
Did she know who you are?

SAM
No, I didn’t reveal my secret identity, Josh.

JOSH
I’m asking some questions here.

SAM
Yes. She knows I work for the President.

JOSH
You don’t think that she...

SAM
No.

JOSH
Let me finish...

SAM
No, I’m saying no, she wouldn’t say anything.

JOSH
How do you know?

SAM
I know.

JOSH
How do you know?

SAM
I know.

JOSH
You want to call her again, don’t you?

SAM
Look, I really like her, and she’s not what you think.

JOSH
The only thing I know about her is she’s a call girl. Is she a call girl?

SAM
Yes.

JOSH
Then so far she’s exactly what I think.

SAM
I just think I left abruptly. I think it was rude.

JOSH
Oh, you’re gonna try and reform her, aren’t you?

SAM
No.

JOSH
You are.

SAM
I just didn’t say a proper goodbye that, you know, shows a little respect.

JOSH
Sam...

SAM
You know what, you’d like her if you met her, Josh.

JOSH
You got to promise me this is never gonna happen, Sam.

Donna knocks and pokes her head in.

JOSH
Yes?

DONNA
You’re with the Energy Secretary in five minutes.

JOSH
Thanks.

DONNA
What’s going on?

JOSH
Nothing.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
You’re lying?

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
So I should get out?

JOSH
Yes. [Donna leaves] Look, whatever quest...

SAM
It’s not a quest.

JOSH
Whatever. You’re playing with fire here. Just talk to Toby before you do 
anything.

SAM
Toby?

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
There’s no way that I can do this without talking to Toby?

JOSH
No. [opens the door and sees C.J. walking by] Ooh! Ooh! Hang on there. C.J.! 
[to Sam] Just talk to Toby. Just Toby.

SAM
All right.

Josh walks out. Donna gives him a file. He catches up with C.J.

DONNA
You’re late.

JOSH
Thank you. C.J....

C.J.
I’m gonna kill him, Josh.

JOSH
I would definitely talk to him.

C.J.
Oh, I’m gonna talk to him, all right.

JOSH
I want you to stay on the perimeter.

C.J.
I’ve been staying on the perimeter.

JOSH
I don’t want it on Leo’s desk. Thank you

Josh stops as C.J. continues to walk a little faster. C.J. lets out a loud, 
angry scream. Some staffers look at her strangely as she walks down the hall.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
VICE PRESIDENT JOHN HOYNES is inside talking to a Frenchman. Several reporters 
surround the room as their cameras flash everywhere.

HOYNES
C’est un vrai plasir et un honneur. D’etre votre hote aujurd’hui que vous 
surviviez cette challeure du fin de septembre. Et que ce jour soit le jour ou 
on construit pour le future.

FRENCHMAN
Absolument. Tres bien dis.

HOYNES
Excellent.

C.J. comes in the room and stands next to STEVIE one of the Vice President’s 
staffers.

C.J.
Hey Stevie.

STEVIE
Hey C.J.

C.J.
Does he have a minute?

STEVIE
We’re leaving for New York.

C.J.
It’ll just be a minute.

STEVIE
I’m looking at my watch.

HOYNES
[to Frenchman] Good luck. [to everyone in general] Thank you. Good luck 
everyone.

Hoynes heads for the door as C.J. approaches him. His staff follows behind as 
they walk hurriedly down the hall.

C.J.
Excuse me, Mr. Vice President?

HOYNES
C.J.

C.J.
Sir, I-I wanted to talk to you for a moment about A3-C3.

HOYNES
Yes.

C.J.
I wanted to apologize since I’ve been quickly here and in getting everyone on 
the same page, sometimes people get left behind for a day or two...

HOYNES
[to a staffer behind him] Candy, the most he was talking about in terms of the 
subsidy was six dollars an acre.

CANDY
We’re fixing it.

STEVIE
Sir?

C.J.
I was saying that had we properly briefed your office...

HOYNES
[to another staffer] Bill, it was six dollars an acre, Candy said.

BILL
Got it.

HOYNES
Thanks.

C.J.
Sir?

HOYNES
C.J., it was nice of you to come find me, but I’ve been kept in the loop on 
AC cubed.

C.J.
The quote the room is running with is, “This is the time when the President 
needs our support.”

HOYNES
Yes.

C.J.
Well, you can see how that might be interpreted...?

HOYNES
[suddenly stops walking and everyone with him]  C.J.?

C.J.
Yes, sir?

HOYNES
I’ve got my own press secretary.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

STEVIE
Sir?

HOYNES
I got to run.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

C.J. falls silent. She stares at Hoynes as he and his staff walk away. 

CUT TO: THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is having his physical check-up. Morris has just finished taking his 
blood pressure.

BARTLET
What’s in Jordan?

MORRIS
Amman.

BARTLET
You should stay here. We got Amman, a woman, little kids, the works.

MORRIS
131 over 84.

BARTLET
See, that was a joke.

MORRIS
Good one.

BARTLET
Everybody’s a critic today.

MORRIS
Hold still.

BARTLET
So what’s in Amman?

MORRIS
A teaching hospital.

BARTLET
Good for you. How long are you gonna stay?

MORRIS
A week.

BARTLET
When do you leave?

MORRIS
Two hours.

BARTLET
What’s my temperature?

MORRIS
56 degrees.

BARTLET
Fahrenheit?

MORRIS
Yeah. Is that not normal?

BARTLET
[chuckles] So how’s the kid?

MORRIS
Ten days old today.

BARTLET
Can she spell anything yet?

MORRIS
No, sir.

BARTLET
Got any pictures?

MORRIS
Thought you’d never ask. [gives him one]

NANCY
[comes in] Sir, they just touched down at Andrews.

BARTLET
Thank you, Nancy.

Nancy leaves. Bartlet looks at the picture.

BARTLET
Oh, she’s beautiful. What’s her name?

MORRIS
Angela’s my wife. Corey’s our daughter. It’s my grandmother’s name. She got it 
from her great aunt, who got it from the first free woman she ever met.

BARTLET
That name’s got a hell of a past.

MORRIS
My family’s very proud of its past as you can tell.

BARTLET
Your wife’s beautiful too. How’d you get her to marry you? Did you trick her 
or something?

MORRIS
Hypnosis.

BARTLET
Yeah, I figured. [beat] Morris, I made a joke about golfers yesterday, and now 
it consumes the whole damn building.

MORRIS
Open your mouth, sir.

BARTLET
Jokes like that are part of my folksy charm, Morris. It’s the very heart of my 
popularity.

MORRIS
Don’t you have a job approval rating of like three percent or something?

BARTLET
Oh, we’re having some difficulty getting the word out.

Carol comes in and gives Bartlet a file.

BARTLET
Oh, thank you. Is this from this morning, Carol?

CAROL
Yes, sir. [leaves]

BARTLET
[sighs] So how’s my pulse?

MORRIS
Have you been running up and down the stairs at the Rose Bowl in the past few 
minutes?

BARTLET
No.

MORRIS
Then it’s not that good. Cut back on red meat?

BARTLET
Yeah.

MORRIS
Dairy?

BARTLET
Yeah.

MORRIS
How about booze?

BARTLET
[jokingly] Yeah, why not? Two Dewars on the rocks, Mrs. Landingham.

MORRIS
[smiles] Mr. President...

BARTLET
I had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs. [beat] I’m an accomplished 
man, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even 
the pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I’m 
back at my father’s dinner table.

MORRIS
I’m a naval officer, sir...

BARTLET
You’re a naval officer. You’re a doctor in a uniform. [beat] It’s not like I’m 
totally without experience, you know. 

MORRIS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You’re talking to a former governor. I was commander-in-chief of the New 
Hampshire National Guard.

MORRIS
You guys got into a lot of tough scrapes, did you?

BARTLET
Didn’t have to. We’d just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we’d all 
go for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in 
premed, huh?

MORRIS
Hold still just a second.

BARTLET
What is that?

MORRIS
It’s a flu shot.

BARTLET
I don’t need a flu shot.

MORRIS
You do need a flu shot.

BARTLET
How do I know this isn’t the start of a military coup?

MORRIS
Sir?

BARTLET
I want the Secret Service in here right away.

MORRIS
In the event of a military coup, sir, what makes you think the Secret Service 
is gonna be on your side?

BARTLET
Now that’s a thought that’s gonna fester.

MORRIS
Hold still.

Morris gives him the flu shot. Bartlet groans a little, and then holds his arm 
after the shot.

BARTLET
Thank you. I’m not comfortable with violence. [beat] I know this country has 
enemies, but I don’t feel violent toward any of them. I don’t know whether 
that’s a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would answer 
that question.

MORRIS
Let the chiefs get to know you, Mr. President. They’re serious men, naturally 
suspicious of your leadership. That’s what comes from spending a lifetime 
caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. They’re men of character. They 
may not like your résumé, but they’ll like you personally if you give it time. 
[beat] You have a once in a generation mind, sir. Ultimately, they’ll respect 
that. They’ll advise you well and go where you point. Let the chiefs get to 
know you, sir. In the meantime, you outrank them. So don’t worry about it so 
much, and cut back on the dairy.

BARTLET
And the red meat.

MORRIS
And the scotch.

BARTLET
Don’t forget your picture. Corey’s a beautiful child.

MORRIS
[looks at picture] Yeah, I know. Look what I’d done.

BARTLET
You didn’t do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job is to 
pay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do.

MORRIS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Also, you got to teach her how to whistle. Her mother won’t do that.

MORRIS
Right.

BARTLET
I’ll see you next week, Morris.

MORRIS
In two weeks.

BARTLET
Right. [Morris heads for the door.] Morris?

MORRIS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Look at that picture again. See? The past isn’t the only thing your family can 
be proud of.

MORRIS
[beat] Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Go away.

Morris leaves. He passes Leo walking inside with two distinguished men.

LEO
Mr. President, you remember Stuart White and Ray Finley?

BARTLET
I do, indeed. Mr. White, good to see you. Mr. Finley...

WHITE and FINLEY shake hands with the President.

FADE OUT.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Donna and Josh are walking through the bullpen.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
What do you want for the pool this Saturday?

JOSH
Another hundred bucks?

DONNA
You can’t win if you don’t play.

JOSH
I see it different.

DONNA
Who do you like? Rocky Mountain College or Purdue?

JOSH
Tell you what, can you give me Yeshiva University over the Dallas Cowboys?

DONNA 
If you’re not going to take this seriously...

C.J.
[walks up] Excuse me. Leo will be ready for us in about a half hour.

JOSH
Thanks. Ah, C.J.?

C.J.
Yes?

JOSH
Did you talk to Hoynes?

C.J. 
Yeah.

JOSH
And?

C.J.
We’re fine.

JOSH
You’re sure?

C.J.  
Yeah

JOSH 
C.J.?

C.J.
We’re fine.

JOSH
Okay.

C.J.
Leo will call when he’s ready.

JOSH 
Anyone but Mandy.

C.J.
Right. [walks off]

CUT TO: INT. MANDY’S CONDO - DAY
Mandy is sitting in the stairs. Daisy picks up a wine bottle and joins Mandy in 
the stairs.

MANDY
I have a Ph.D. Did you know that?

DAISY
Yes.

MANDY
Some people don’t know that.

DAISY
I do.

MANDY
I’ve got a bachelor’s degree in art history, and a master’s degree in 
communications and a Ph.D. in political science.

DAISY
Yes.

MANDY
I’m accomplished and brilliant. And yet, look how young and cute I am.

DAISY
What about Gil McGregor?

MANDY
And who would think that someone who’d accomplished as much as I have, would be 
this young or this cute?

DAISY 
Gil McGregor?

MANDY
And here I am.

DAISY
Mandy.

MANDY
I am not calling Gil Mcgregor!

DAISY
Why not?

MANDY
I’m not cold-calling businesses like an encyclopedia salesman.

DAISY
Fine.

MANDY
You do it. [Daisy gives her a knowing look] No. Neither of us has to do it. 
Things haven’t gotten that bad.

DAISY
Miss Hampton, we are sitting on the stairs, drinking wine out of paper cups.

MANDY
I’d like it if you called me Dr. Hampton.

DAISY
Give me the bottle. [Mandy does.]

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Outside Sam’s office, a phone rings. Cathy answers it.

CATHY 
Sam Seaborn’s office.

MAN [on phone]
Hi, it’s Danny for Sam.

CATHY
He’s writing now, Danny. He asked me to hold his calls.

SAM
[walks out of his office] Okay.

CATHY
He just came out. I’ll have him call you back.

SAM
I’m done.

CATHY
You’re sure?

SAM
Yep.

CATHY
You’re done polishing?

SAM
Yes.

CATHY
You’re done tweaking?

SAM
I’m done tweaking, I’m done polishing. Done. Take it to C.J. [Cathy starts to 
walk.] Wait. [looks at the speech one final time, to double check] Yes, I’m 
done, really.

Cathy walks towards C.J.’s Office with papers from Sam. Behind him, TOBY'S 
OFFICE opens. Sam walks towards it where a meeting is breaking up. Toby is 
speaking to communications staffers Ed and Larry leaving his office.

TOBY
Wait and hope that the statement comes out of the U.N. by the end of the week.

ED
It’s the least we can do.

TOBY
No, actually the U.N. is already doing the least they can do.

ED
Right. [exits] Hey Sam, what’s up?

SAM
Just stretching my legs.

TOBY
[to Sam] Hey.

SAM
Hey.

TOBY
How’s it going?

SAM
I’m finished.

TOBY
You’re talking about the Hilton head draft?

SAM
I used pretty tough language... “political cover,” “counterproductive.”

TOBY
Good.

SAM
Now, I’m just stretching my legs.

TOBY
Good.

SAM
Can I talk to you a second?

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
I’ll shut the door.

TOBY
Okay.

SAM
[closes the door and sits] About a week ago, I accidentally slept with a 
prostitute.

Toby slowly looks up from his desk to Sam.

TOBY
Really?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
You accidentally slept with a prostitute?

SAM
Call girl.

TOBY
Accidentally?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
I don’t understand. Did you trip over something?

SAM
I did not know she was a call girl.

TOBY
There wasn’t a red flag when she charged you money in exchange for sex?

SAM
She didn’t charge me, Toby, come on... I didn’t find out about it, till the 
next day.

TOBY
Where did you meet her?

SAM
The Four Seasons.

TOBY
Did anyone see you?

SAM
No.

TOBY 
You’re sure?

SAM
Yes, although I was with Billy for a time.

TOBY
Billy who?

SAM 
Kenworthy.

TOBY
Bill Kenworthy...

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
...of The Wall Street Journal!

SAM
He sat, to talk to me about Josh. It was during the whole Mary Marsh thing, but 
he got up and left well before...

TOBY 
Before you picked up a hooker.

SAM
Call girl.

TOBY
Well, that’s a distinction that’s gonna be very important to the Grand Jury.

SAM
I haven’t broken any laws.

TOBY
Who else knows about this?

SAM
Josh.

TOBY
And who else?

SAM
That’s it.

TOBY
So it’s just me, you, the hooker, the President’s deputy chief of staff, and 
The Wall Street Journal!

SAM
You know what Toby? She’s not a hooker.

TOBY
Hang on a second, Sam.

SAM
I’d like to call her, just to say we can be friends, I don’t see the danger in 
that...

TOBY
[rubs his forehead] No, no, Sam, no. You’re going to try and reform her?

SAM
No.

TOBY
I think you are.

SAM
I think she shouldn’t have to feel like trash, because I have a job where 
adults aren’t given the benefit of the doubt.

JOSH
[walks in] Let’s go.

SAM
He’s free?

JOSH
Yeah.

Toby looks at Sam before leaving. They all walk.
 
TOBY 
[to Josh]  Did you know about this?

JOSH
Know about what?

TOBY
[indicating Sam] With him. 

JOSH
Yes.

TOBY
And you’re not concerned?

JOSH
Who among us hasn’t known forbidden love, Toby? Why spring break alone...

SAM 
I was going to say...

TOBY
This administration doesn’t even need an opposition party, do you know that, we 
do fine by ourselves.

JOSH
Sam, just don’t do anything stupid okay?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Nice job on the Hilton head draft.

The three enter LEO’S OFFICE. C.J. and Leo are already there.

LEO
You have three minutes, what do you want?

TOBY
A full time consultant.

LEO
The dollar is down 3 cents against the Yen; up 2 pennies against the Euro. Know 
what we need more than a media consultant?  An economic stimulus package that 
doesn’t look like it was put together at an Amway rally.

JOSH
Yes, but that’s not the meeting we’re having right now.

LEO
Fair point.

JOSH
The Ryder Cup shouldn’t have even ended up on our radar screen.

LEO
That’s right.

JOSH
So you’ll let us hire a media consultant? You’ll let the D.N.C. spend some 
money?

LEO
Absolutely.

TOBY
Who do we get?

LEO
Mandy.

TOBY
Excellent choice.

JOSH
Yes... Wait, What?

SAM
Mandy.

C.J. 
Who is recently unemployed, and by the way, I don’t think Josh has gotten 
enough credit for that. [She applauds. Sam joins in.]

LEO
We need her again, Josh.

JOSH
Mandy?

LEO
We need her.

JOSH
Wait a second. This is an ambush.

LEO
Can you think...?

JOSH
I’m getting mugged and you’re the gang leader.

LEO
Can you think of a single reason not to use Mandy that isn’t personal?

JOSH
Sure.

LEO 
What?

JOSH
[beat] She used to be my girlfriend!

LEO
That’s good enough for me. Let’s do it.

TOBY
Excellent.

JOSH
Hang on.

SAM
This is going to be great.

JOSH
Wait, I-I have certain objections.

LEO
Like what?

JOSH
For one thing, the President would never go for this.

LEO
Sure he will.

JOSH
How do you know?

LEO and JOSH
I [You] already asked him.

JOSH
All right... listen... fine... I’m a team player. I think my record is pretty 
clear on that.

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
As long as she understands that she answers to me and she answers to Toby. I 
don’t want to have to go 15 rounds with her in the Oval Office.

LEO
Toby, does that wrap it up?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Thank you, everybody.

JOSH
I’m going to draw a chart for her with lines and arrows, clearly indicating 
that she answers to me and she answers to Toby.

LEO
C.J., hang on a second. 

Everyone leaves. C.J. stands just inside the door.

LEO
Did you talk to Hoynes today?

C.J.
Yeah, I talked to him for a minute this morning.

LEO
About A3-C3?

C.J.
Yep.

LEO
I mean about the quote.

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
And?

C.J.
Miscommunication, he’s on board.

LEO 
Yeah?

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO 
I don’t understand, what kind of miscommunication?

C.J.
His statement got truncated, I’d leave it alone.

LEO 
Okay.

C.J.
Anything else?

LEO
No.

C.J.
I’ll be in my office.

C.J. leaves. Josh suddenly comes back in from the other door to make his point.

JOSH
She answers to me and she answers to Toby. 

Leo shakes his head as Josh leaves.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is packing his briefcase. Mrs. Landingham is with him.

BARTLET 
Mrs. Landingham?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I’m done, right?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
There are some calls, but you can make them from the residence. [gives him a 
file and a red paper bag]

BARTLET
All righty. Thank you. What’s in the bag?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Delegation from the University of Nebraska was sorry you couldn’t see them 
during their visit, and they left this for you with their compliments. [pulls 
out a red shirt from the bag]

BARTLET
It’s a shirt.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
They left me a shirt?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I think they left me something else, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Now, Mr. President...

BARTLET
I think they left me 12 center-cut prime fillet Omaha Steaks, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Morris Tolliver said...

BARTLET
I was going to have Mario fix me one of those steaks tonight. 

He walks out into the PORTICO. Mrs. Landingham follows.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Dr. Tolliver was very clear about...

BARTLET
You stole my steaks.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I didn’t steal them. I was simply following the direct orders of Captain Morris 
Tolliver, M.D. who would like to see your diet contain a little less...

BARTLET
You are a cattle rustler, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
If you say so, Mr. President... And no scotch tonight, sir.

BARTLET
Between you and Dr. Tolliver, who needs a wife or a mother?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good night, Mr. President.

Bartlet walks toward the residence. Mrs. Landingham returns to the office.

CUT TO: INT. MANDY’S CONDO - NIGHT
Mandy sits on the stairs and Daisy sits on the floor. They’re going over a list.

DAISY
Christensen?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
Stillwell?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
Crouse?

MANDY
The one from Indiana?

DAISY
Alabama.

MANDY
No.

DAISY
How about the one from Indiana?

MANDY
No.

The two don’t notice Josh entering.

DAISY
Kittis?

MANDY 
No.

DAISY
Waveman?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
Brock?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
Uh, Silverman?

JOSH
Bartlet.

Mandy and Daisy swiftly look at him.

JOSH
What about Bartlet?

MANDY
What are you doing here?

JOSH
Jed Bartlet, Nobel Laureate in Economics, three-term congressman, two-term 
Governor, You guys look like you could use a client. What do you say? You want 
to work for the leader of the free world?

MANDY
[approaches] Josh! Well it took you long enough. [hits Josh in the arm]

JOSH 
Ow!

MANDY
You kept me out of the loop for a year. Sure, once the Ryder cup team...

JOSH
Okay...

MANDY
Which by the way...

JOSH
Okay, we have some rules.

MANDY
I don’t want to hear your rules.

DAISY
What are the rules?

JOSH
Number one, she can’t punch me. Number two, I prefer it if the two of you 
didn’t get drunk in the middle of the day.

MANDY
No.

DAISY 
Agreed.

MANDY
Fine.

DAISY
Oh, you don’t know how much we appreciate this, Josh.

MANDY
It’s not like he’s doing us a favor.

DAISY
You are a good man, Josh!

JOSH
Yes, I really am quite something.

MANDY
I just want to die.

DAISY
We don’t even know how to thank you.

JOSH
The look on Mandy’s face is thanks enough. Get your coats. You hungry?

MANDY
No.

DAISY
Yes.

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
Lets go. Rule number 3, and I really can’t emphasize this enough, you answer to 
me and you answer to Toby. My office is drawing up some instructional charts 
that pretty much outline the chain of command. For instance, you answer to me 
and you answer to Toby.

MANDY
I understand.

JOSH
Do you?

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
Good.

The three start to go out.

MANDY
In your dreams.

JOSH
Mandy!

MANDY
In your little dreams!

Daisy turns off the lights and closes the door. 

CUT TO:INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is reading. Margaret walks in.

MARGARET
Excuse me. The Vice President is here.

LEO
Thanks.

HOYNES
Hey, Leo.

LEO
Good evening Mr. Vice President.

LEO
Thanks, Margaret.

Margaret leaves the office. Leo and Hoynes sit in opposite ends.

LEO
How was New York?

HOYNES
Standard and Poor’s going to raise the city’s credit rating.

LEO
Good.

HOYNES
Nice of you to call me over. We don’t see enough of each other.

LEO
No.

HOYNES
Margaret’s looking good.

LEO
Did you blow off C.J. Cregg this morning?

HOYNES
Leo...

LEO
I’m asking...

HOYNES
Is that what this is about?

LEO
Did you?

HOYNES
You know what, C.J. doesn’t need to come running to you every time she hits a 
bump...

LEO
C.J. did not come running, John, she covered your ass, she’s a good girl. And 
when she tells you something, I want you to consider it a directive from this 
office.

HOYNES
You want me to consider it a directive from this office?

LEO
Yes.

HOYNES
Well, let me consult Article Two of the Constitution, cause I’m not a hundred 
percent sure where this office gets the authority to direct me to the men’s room!

LEO
You really want to do this now?

HOYNES
Leo, I have had it up to here, with you and your pal! I’ve been shoved into a 
broom...

LEO
[gets riled] Excuse me! Me and my pal?

HOYNES
Yes.

LEO
You are referring to President Bartlet?

HOYNES
Yes.

LEO
Refer to him that way.

HOYNES
[gets up] Goodnight, Leo.

LEO
Don’t do what you’re doing, John.

HOYNES
You’re a world class political operative, Leo. Why the hell shouldn’t I keep 
doing what I’ve been doing?

LEO 
‘Cause I’ll win, and you’ll end up playing celebrity golf for the rest of your 
life.

HOYNES
How long do you expect me to stick around here and be his whipping boy?

LEO
Give this President anything less than your full-throated support, and you’re 
going to find out exactly how long.

HOYNES
Goodnight, Leo.

LEO
Goodnight, John.

Hoynes leaves. Leo picks up the paperwork from the table and continues to read.
FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT
Sam comes in the restaurant. He looks around the place full of distinguished 
people. He sees a familiar woman by the bar and approaches her.

SAM
Excuse me. Hi.

WOMAN
Hi.

SAM
I’m looking for Laurie.

WOMAN
I don’t know anyone named Laurie.

SAM
Laurie’s not her real name.

WOMAN
Laurie’s not her real name?

SAM
Actually, Laurie is her real name. The name you know her by is not her real 
name. I saw her with you the other night.

WOMAN
Oh, yeah. I remember you.

SAM
Ah. More good news for Toby.

WOMAN
What?

SAM
Nothing. Could you tell me where she is?

WOMAN
She’s in the back.

SAM
Thank you. [heads towards the back]

WOMAN
She’s busy.

SAM
Only take a sec!

IN THE BACK AREA. We see Laurie sitting with two older men and another woman 
around a table.

MAN
Hongkong? That place has really gone downhill since they changed chefs.

Everyone in the table laughs. Sam just walks up.

SAM
Hi.

LAURIE
[out of her laugh] Hi!

SAM
Look at this. I come in for a drink, and here you are.

LAURIE
[now uncomfortable] How ‘bout that?

SAM
How you doing?

MAN
Hi.

LAURIE
This is...

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

MAN
From the White House?

SAM
Yes, sir. [They shake hands.]

LAURIE
Sam.

SAM
I hope you don’t mind my barging in like this. It’s just that I’ve known this 
girl my whole life.

WOMAN
How do you know Brittany?

SAM
Who’s Brittany?

LAURIE
I am.

SAM
Okay.

LAURIE
Sam, we’re in the middle of something here...

SAM
No problem. I don’t mean to interrupt. I’ll just go back to the bar and call 
my friend, the Assistant U.S. Attorney General, and see if he wants to come 
down and meet for a drink with me and that woman back there.

LAURIE
Excuse me. [leaves abruptly]

SAM
[to man] Good to meet you. [to the other man] Okay.

CUT TO:EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - NIGHT
Laurie comes out of the restaurant. Sam is walking behind her.

SAM
Laurie. I called you four times. You said you were gonna call me back.

LAURIE
Stay away from me.

SAM
Laurie?

LAURIE
I can’t believe you just did that!

SAM
I came here in the spirit of...

LAURIE
I left my jacket at the table. I can’t go back there.

SAM
If I cost you some money, I’ll write you a check.

LAURIE
You go to hell for saying that.

SAM
I wasn’t... [Laurie walks off ahead of Sam. He follows behind.] I’m sorry. 
That was the wrong thing to say.

LAURIE
Yes.

SAM
You’re gonna freeze out here.

LAURIE
I don’t care.

SAM
Take my coat.

LAURIE
No.

SAM
Come on.

LAURIE
Give it to me. [She stops. Sam helps her put on the coat.] I can’t believe you 
said that in there. I backed away from you so quietly, Sam. You know I did. I 
never would have caused you any trouble. And then you come in and you brandish 
this... by the way, the Attorney General has no jurisdiction here. [walks again]

SAM
Are you...?

LAURIE
I break the law in the district. I break the law in Maryland. And from time to 
time, I break the law in Pennsylvania. In my life, I have never committed a 
federal crime, which is more than I can say for some people in your line of work.

SAM
You’re absolutely right about that.

LAURIE
I need a cab. [waves to a cab passing by but it didn’t stop]

SAM
So I had a pretty good day.

LAURIE
Congratulations.

SAM
I feel like more and more I’m putting a role in policy discussions and then 
today I...

LAURIE
Why did you come and find me tonight?

SAM
What?

LAURIE
Why did you call me four times, and then come and find me?

SAM
I just... to tell you that I had a pretty good day.

LAURIE
I don’t need saving, Sam.

SAM
Yeah, you do.

LAURIE
Are you aware that I make more money than you do?

SAM
You and any kid with a decent paper route.

LAURIE
And you understand that I wasn’t abused as a child, that I like what I do?

SAM
Really?

LAURIE
That it’s putting me through law school?

SAM
I wouldn’t knock yourself out in torts because there’s no state law in this 
country that’s gonna admit you with a solicitation bust on your record.

LAURIE
I don’t plan on getting busted.

SAM
As opposed to the other people that do?

LAURIE
Sam...

SAM
And I gotta tell you... [They stop walking.] I think you look terrific tonight.

LAURIE
Thank you.

SAM
And I’m not just saying that because I want my coat back.

LAURIE
You’re gonna try and change me, arguing, asserting a position every time I turn 
around...

SAM
I’m a lawyer and a speechwriter. I argue for a living, and I’m sought after 
because I’m good at it.

LAURIE
You humiliated me back there. And you scared me. You understand that?

SAM
Yeah.

LAURIE
And?

SAM
I guess that’s just the way it goes.

LAURIE
Well, that’s not good enough.

SAM
It’s gonna have to be.

LAURIE
Why?

SAM
‘Cause I’ve decided to become a good friend of yours.

LAURIE
Oh, am I just supposed to strip down for you now?

SAM
No.

LAURIE
Really?

SAM
Really.

LAURIE
So what are we supposed to do?

SAM
I don’t know, but whatever it is, can we do it indoors because I’m from 
Southern California.

LAURIE
Yeah.

SAM
Good.

LAURIE
You want to buy me a drink?

SAM
I have to say, that sounded very professional to me.

LAURIE
Shut up.

SAM
Okay.

They start walking, but this time, we don’t follow them.

LAURIE
So you’re gonna reveal state secrets?

SAM
To be honest with you, I don’t think I know any state secrets.

LAURIE
Now, he tells me.

SAM
I can recite the members of Congress in alphabetical order.

LAURIE
Ooh, geez, Sam. How do the girls stay on their feet with you?

SAM
And I got some patter with the capital gains tax, too.

Laurie laughs as they continue to walk away.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
3:35 A.M.
There is an unusual crowding in the White House hallways at this time of night. 
There are numbers of staffers walking. Among them, we see Toby coming in the 
Roosevelt Room.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT
President Bartlet, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, walks towards the Oval 
Office. He passes by a Secret Service Agent, who whispers to the mike on his 
wrist.

AGENT
Eagle’s by.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Leo and Josh are with several military officers.

JOSH
So they’ll be in position in two hours?

OFFICER 1
And they’d be booked up by a second carrier group plus the F-14s off the George 
Washington and the Carlston.

LEO
How long before an estimated B.D.A.?

OFFICER 2
Ten minutes.

AGENT
[walks up from behind Leo] The President’s waiting.

LEO
Excuse me, gentlemen. [heads for the door]

JOSH
Leo, do you need me?

LEO
No.

Leo leaves. We see Toby and Sam looking on in the other end of the room.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
The President is leaning on his desk. Leo comes in and walks slowly toward him.

LEO
Mr. President, Morris Tolliver is dead.

The bad news hits the President hard.

LEO [cont.]
An airforce transport carrying Morris, 1200 other doctors, 42 support staff, 
and a crew of five to a teaching hospital in Amman exploded in midair about 
150 miles north of Tartus. What was first thought to be a mechanical failure 
was then claimed by a fundamentalist group after a keyhole satellite sent back 
a record of a heat stream coming from what’s called an F.I.M. 92, which is a 
shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missile launcher. In the last 90 minutes or so 
that’s been debunked as well. Hard intelligence is telling us the order came 
from the Syrian defense ministry. Baker and Lennox are on their way from the 
Pentagon, and Brodie’s in the Situation Room preparing for your briefing.

Bartlet takes a moment before he speaks.

BARTLET
What time is it?

LEO
It’s 10:38 in Damascus.

BARTLET
Where is the Syrian ambassador?

LEO
He’s at his residence on a secure phone line.

BARTLET
Tel Aviv and London?

LEO
State’s waiting for your word.

BARTLET
Alright, uh... [big sigh] I’m gonna call Morris’ wife now. I’ll meet you in the 
Situation Room.

LEO
Yes, sir. [heads for the door]

BARTLET
Leo?

Leo turns around.

BARTLET
I am not frightened. I’m gonna blow them off the face of the earth with the 
fury of God’s own thunder. [beat] Get the commanders.

A look of concern is on Leo's face. He slowly turns around, opens the door 
and leaves. From the portico, we see Bartlet walking around behind his desk. 
He sits on his chair and lets out a big sigh. He then picks up the phone and 
makes the call.

West Wing S01E03
Still seething over the downing of an fully loaded American jet in the Mideast, a vengeful President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) overrules the joint chiefs' plan for a "proportional" military strike and demands a more severe attack that would result in thousands of enemy and civilian casualties. While Leo (John Spencer) and other advisers try to cool off the Commander-in-Chief, Press Secretary C.J. (Allison Janney) scolds a wayward Sam (Rob Lowe) over his potentially explosive private crusade to rescue a well-known call girl from her profession. Feeling overlooked during the hubbub surrounding the military options, Josh (Bradley Whitford) interviews a shy African-American teen, Charlie Young (Dul� Hill) as a potential personal aide to the President.

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE/LOBBY - DAY 
Josh slides his I.D. card in the card scanner. Donna comes up behind as they walk 
to JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA.

DONNA
C.J.’s looking for you. 

JOSH
Huh? 

DONNA
C.J.’s looking for you. 

JOSH
Donna? 

DONNA
Yes? 

JOSH
"Good morning, Josh" is a pretty good way to start the day. 

DONNA
Good morning. 

JOSH
What’s up? 

DONNA
C.J.’s looking for you. 

JOSH
Tell her I’m in the office. 

DONNA
Josh, I’m saying C.J. is looking for you. 

They stop walking. 

JOSH
What did I do? 

DONNA
How would I know? 

JOSH
‘Cause you know everything. 

DONNA
I do know everything. 

JOSH
Donna... 

DONNA
I’m saying you say that now, but every time I want to make a substantive 
contribution... 

JOSH
You make plenty of substantive contributions. 

DONNA
Like what? 

JOSH
This! This could be a substantive contribution. 

DONNA
I need a raise. 

JOSH
So do I! [They start walking again]

DONNA
You’re my boss. 

JOSH
Do-- but I’m not the one who pays you. 

DONNA
Yeah, but you could recommend that I get a raise. 

JOSH
Donna, she’s looking for me. Do you really think this is the best time to talk 
about a raise? 

DONNA
Hmmm... I think this is the best time to talk about a raise. [smiles] 

JOSH
Donna, you’re not a very nice person. 

DONNA
You got to get to know me. 

JOSH
Donna? 

DONNA
[sighs] The best I can cobble together from the small shards of information I’ve 
been able to overhear in the restroom and the Danish cart... 

JOSH
Donna... 

DONNA
Is it possible that there’s a situation involving Sam, a woman, and C.J. being 
denied information about something? 

He now realizes why C.J. was looking for him. 

JOSH
Ok. Here’s what I’m gonna do. 

DONNA
Hide in your office? 

JOSH
No. I’m not gonna hide in my office. I’m gonna go into my office and devise a 
strategy. That is what I do. I’m a professional. I’m not a little boy. 

DONNA
Hmm. That’s the spirit. 

JOSH
But if she calls, I’m at the dentist. I’ll be back in an hour. 

DONNA
Got it. 

Josh then walks into HIS OFFICE. 

He immediately sees C.J. sitting on his desk reading a newspaper. He SCREAMS. 
C.J. looks pissed. 

C.J.
Wow, are you stupid!

ACT ONE 

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. takes her legs off Josh's desk and folds the newspaper she was reading.

JOSH
You can’t be mad at me about this, C.J.

C.J.
Really? Let’s see if I can, let’s see if I can find it in me.

Donna enters.

DONNA
Wait, she was here?

C.J.
Could you excuse us Donna?

DONNA
How did I miss that?

JOSH
I don’t know, but you can kiss that raise goodbye.

DONNA
Senior staff in five minutes.

JOSH
Thanks.

Donna leaves. Josh slams the door behind her.

C.J.
A call girl?

JOSH
Here’s the thing...

C.J.
A call girl, Josh?

JOSH
You’re not asking me if I’d like a call girl right now are you?

C.J.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

JOSH
See, the thing is, I really don’t think it is that serious.

C.J.
Really?

JOSH
A couple of things for you to bear in mind: he didn’t know she was a call girl when 
he went home with her. He didn’t pay her money. He didn’t have knowledge of; witness 
or participate in anything illegal. Or for that matter, unethical, immoral or suspect.

C.J.
A couple of things for you to bear in mind: none of that matters on Hard Copy!

JOSH
You’re overreacting.

C.J.
Am I?

C.J. starts moving towards Josh.

JOSH
Yes.

C.J.
As women are prone to do?

JOSH
That’s not what I mean.

C.J.
That’s always what you mean. [They are now face to face.]

JOSH
I really think I’m the best judge of what I mean, you paranoid Berkeley shiksta 
feminista! [beat] Whoa. That was way too far.

C.J.
No, no. Well, I’ve got a staff meeting to go to and so do you, you elitist, Harvard 
fascist missed-the-Dean’s-list-two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jackass!

JOSH
Feel better getting that off your chest there, C.J.?

C.J.
I’m a whole new woman.

C.J. opens the door and they exit to the HALLWAY.

JOSH
You look like a million bucks by the way.

C.J.
Don’t try to make up with me.

JOSH
I’ll talk to Sam.

C.J.
I’ll talk to Sam.

They walk through the doors into the NORTHWEST LOBBY. Toby enters the building. 
Josh stops to talk to him. They all walk.

JOSH
Toby.

TOBY
Hey.

JOSH
How was last night?

TOBY
The longest dinner of my life. The President was up from the table every five 
minutes teeing off on Cashman and Berryhill. He’s barking at the Secretary of State, 
he’s scaring the hell out of Fitzwallace, which I didn’t think was possible. He’s 
snapping at the First Lady. He’s talking about blowing up half of North Africa.

C.J. 
He’s snapping at Mrs. Bartlet?

JOSH
C.J. this might be a good time to tell the President about Sam and the call girl.

TOBY
She knows?

C.J.
Yes, I’m afraid I have that information now, and I’ll be in to see you very shortly 
my friend.

TOBY
How the hell did I get into trouble?

JOSH
Today, all you had to do was get out of bed.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are walking outside towards the Oval Office.

BARTLET
This is crap. It’s been three days. This is amateur hour.

LEO
Cashman and Berryhill have to revise the response scenario so that they speak to State...

BARTLET
Cashman and Berryhill are dragging their feet. Cashman and Berryhill are trying to make me look like a clown. And State should concern itself with what I damn well tell ‘em to be concerned with!

LEO
It doesn’t work like that. [opens the door to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE]

BARTLET
So I’ve discovered.

NANCY
Good morning Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good morning.

LEO
Moreover you know that’s not the way it works. The Chiefs are working as swiftly as 
they can... [They enter the OVAL OFFICE. Mrs. Landingham is already there.] ...even 
though, frankly, time isn’t a factor.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning Mr. President. [hands Bartlet a paper]

BARTLET
Good morning.

LEO
And not to pile on, but Cashmen and Berryhill have a point with respect to the 
Security Council.

BARTLET 
[standing behind his desk] Uh, Mrs. Landingham, I can’t seem to find my glasses 
anywhere. Can you please do whatever it is you do when I can’t find my glasses?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Certainly sir. [leaves]

BARTLET
It’s been 72 hours Leo. That’s more than three days since they blew him out of 
the sky. And I’m tired of waiting dammit! This is candy ass! We are going to draw 
up a response scenario today, I’m going to give the order today, we’re going to 
strike back today.

LEO
I wish you wouldn’t say ‘him’, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
‘Three days since they blew him out of the sky.’ Of course that’s fine while it’s 
just you and me sir, but in there with Fitzwallace and the Chiefs, I hope you say 
‘it’ or ‘the airplane’ not ‘him’.

BARTLET
You think I’m taking this personally.

LEO
I think--

BARTLET
Why the hell shouldn’t I take this personally?

LEO
I think the fact that Morris was on the plane--

BARTLET
Americans were on that plane.

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
I met Morris four or five times, let’s not do this like he was my son.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
[yelling] Mrs. Landingham! 

LEO
Mr. President, I still think we need to talk about... [Mrs. Landingham enters.]

BARTLET
I can’t fine my glasses anywhere.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes sir, we’re on it.

BARTLET
Thank you.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The director is waiting.

BARTLET
[tries to read his watch] Uh, yeah, let’s have him. [Mrs. Landingham leaves.]
What did you want to say?

LEO
Nothing.

BARTLET
You sure?

LEO
Yeah. I got staff.

BARTLET
All right, I’ll see you in an hour.

LEO
Thank you sir. 

Bartlet holds up a file and tries to read it. Leo heads towards his office.
CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo enters from the Oval Office. Toby, Josh, C.J., Ginger and a few staffers 
are in the room.

LEO
Good morning.

JOSH
Hey.

C.J.
Hey Leo.

JOSH 
[through a mouth full of food] How’s his mood?

LEO
How’s his mood?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Don’t worry about it.

C.J.
Toby said he’s snapping--

LEO
And I said don’t worry about it. [hangs up coat and moves toward his desk]

Sam enters. C.J. sits on the couch.

LEO
Hey Sam, what do you know?

SAM
It’s true.

LEO
You’re kidding me.

SAM
I’ve got the transcript from the broadcast.

TOBY
What broadcast?

LEO
Listen to this.

SAM
Congressman Bertram Coles appearing on a radio program in his home district.

JOSH
Right.

LEO
The fifth.

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
East Chester County part of Lofton.

LEO
Who we just recommended cuts in funding for the M6 Beacon.

TOBY
What’d he say?

SAM
He was on the broadcast along with several officers from Cromwell Air Force Base 
when he said regarding the President being weak on defense: "Folks down here are 
patriotic, fiercely patriotic. The President better not be planning on making any 
visits to this base. If he does, he may not get out alive."

TOBY
He said that?

LEO
You believe it?

TOBY
Sitting with military officers.

JOSH
Don’t take the bait.

TOBY
Josh.

JOSH
Don’t take the bait.

TOBY
You better believe I’m going to take the bait.

JOSH
Toby.

LEO
There oughta be a law against it.

TOBY
There is a law against it.

JOSH
Why’d you get him started? 

Leo shrugs.

TOBY
How about threatening the life of the President? He was talking to other people, 
how about conspiracy? Those were military officers, how about treason?!

JOSH
Toby.

TOBY
That was a member of our own party Leo. That was a [pounds fist on Leo’s desk] 
Democrat who said that!

LEO
It’s bad, I know.

TOBY
That’s it?

LEO
Well, what are you gonna do?

TOBY
Have the Justice Department bring him in for questioning pending felony charges.

JOSH
Toby’s right. What’s the good of being in power if you’re not gonna haul your 
enemies in for questioning?

Sam laughs, C.J. kicks Josh in the butt.

TOBY
We’re really not gonna do anything about this?

LEO
Yeah Toby, because what we really need to do is arrest people for being mean to 
the President.

TOBY
There is no law. There is no decency.

JOSH
He’s just getting that now.

LEO 
[moving on] In the event an attack order is given today we’ll need a half hour 
on the networks. Uh, when do they need to be told?

C.J.
90 minutes.

LEO
Wait till the last minute. Toby, start working on a draft for the President.

TOBY
I need to know what we’re hitting.

LEO
Yeah, you and me both.

TOBY
Leo.

LEO
It’s military Toby. You’ll know when you know.

TOBY
Sam, work with the coordinating State department guy.

SAM
Beech.

TOBY
And whoever the spokesperson is.

SAM
Hutchinson.

LEO
Let’s do this right.

JOSH
Not much chance of that.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Josh, C.J., Sam and Toby walk through a set of doors and towards the Lobby.

C.J.
We need to be fully stocked. State Department officials. Pentagon. We’ll need the Embassy Office-

JOSH
We should get McMartin on board.

C.J.
He’s standing by.

JOSH
And Adamley at the Pentagon.

C.J.
We got him.

JOSH
So we’re all set, good. So how do we tell them what we know without telling them what we know?

C.J.
Well we don’t know anything so that shouldn’t be hard. Oh, Samuel, could you stop 
by my office around lunchtime please?

SAM
Sure. 

NORTHWEST LOBBY. C.J. and Josh start walking towards their offices.
Sam and Toby stay behind.

SAM
Think she knows?

TOBY 
[distracted] Yeah.

SAM
Why?

TOBY
Cause she told me she knows.

SAM
Could we talk for a moment?

TOBY
Yeah, my office. I’ll be right back.

Sam takes off for the Communications Office. Ginger walks by. Toby grabs the report 
she’s holding.

TOBY
Hold on. Stay there. [starts walking towards a group of reporters, Ginger follows.]

MIKE
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

MIKE
Did you guys hear what Bertram Coles said on the radio?

TOBY
Yeah.

BOBBI
And?

TOBY
The Secret Service investigates all threats made against the President. It’s White 
House policy not to comment on those investigations.

MIKE
Are you telling me there’s going to be a criminal investigation?

TOBY
[beat] I really can’t comment on that right now. [looks at his watch] Damn, I gotta 
get back to my office.

Toby walks away, Mike, Bobbi and the other reporters walk off upset. Toby hands 
Ginger back the report. He smiles and mouths the words ‘thank you’. Toby exits.
FADE OUT.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is sitting behind her desk. Two staffers are taking notes from her.

C.J.
I think the thing to say is that we don’t think anyone here would be disappointed 
if no one paid attention to the process.

STAFFER
And this is on agriculture?

C.J.
Science and technology. [Sam knocks on the door.] Hey. [beat] We’re done here.

The staffers get up and leave.

SAM
Hi.

C.J.
Hi.

SAM
You wanted to see me. And I think I know what it’s about.

C.J.
Really? You sussed it out, huh? [Sam closes the door.] Let me tell you something 
Sam, you’re a smart guy. But if you can figure it out, and I can figure it out, 
what makes you think that no one in my Press Room can figure it out?

SAM
There’s nothing to figure out.

C.J.
You can’t spend time with a call girl, you’re gonna get caught.

SAM
Caught doing what?

C.J.
Don’t get cute with me.

SAM
You are aware that I didn’t know she was a call girl when I went home with her, 
right?

C.J.
But you called her again and went back to see her.

SAM
I went back to see her, I didn’t go back to solicit her.

C.J.
It doesn’t make a difference.

SAM
It does make a difference.

C.J.
You work in the White House, you work fifty feet from the Oval Office. And you’re 
consorting with a...

SAM
Consorting? I’m friendly with a woman, I like this woman. This woman poses no threat 
to the President. And it’s very likely that owing to my friendship, this woman may 
start living her life in bound, insuring for herself a greater future and isn’t that 
exactly what we’re supposed to be doing here?

C.J.
Oh.

SAM
C.J.

C.J.
You’re there to make her see the error of her ways.

SAM
This is ridiculous. I’m there because I like her. I’m there because it’s there that 
I’d be if this were alcohol or drugs. I’m not sleeping with her, this isn’t tawdry.

C.J.
I don’t care what it is, I care what it looks like.

SAM
And I care what it is! And I think it’s high time we all spend a little less time 
looking good, and a little more time...

C.J.
Being good?

SAM
Yes.

C.J.
Yeah, I’ve heard that one before. And one other thing.

SAM
Are we done?

C.J.
No, Sam, when I say there’s ‘one other thing’ that means we’re not done, that 
there’s one other thing.

SAM
I’m resenting the hell out of this conversation.

C.J.
It was tough to tell from your tone of voice.

SAM
What do you want?

C.J.
I beg your pardon?

SAM
What’s the one other thing?

C.J.
I’m your first phone call.

SAM
When?

C.J.
Before, now, in the future, anytime you’re into something and you don’t know what. 
And you can’t tell me that you thought there was nothing to it, because you sat down 
with Josh and you sat down with Toby. Anytime you’re into something and you don’t 
know what, you don’t keep it from me. I’m your first phone call. I’m your first line 
of defense. You have to let me protect you and you have to let me protect the President.

SAM
Is that what this is about?

C.J.
[stands] What this is about Sam is you’re a high profile, very visible, much noticed 
member...

SAM
You just said three things that all mean the same thing.

C.J.
You’re not going to let this out of your teeth.

SAM
Can I go now C.J.? Because what I think this is about is you. Once again letting the 
character cops win in a forfeit because you don’t have the guts or the strength or the 
courage to say ‘we know what’s right from wrong and this none of your damn business!’

C.J.
[taken aback] Really?

SAM
Yes!

C.J.
Strength, guts or courage?

SAM
Yes.

C.J.
You just said three things that all mean the same thing. [sits]

SAM
C.J.

C.J.
We’re done talking now. You can go. [beat]

SAM 

SAM
[opens the door and starts to leave. C.J. starts typing on her laptop] About the 
retaliatory strike, do you think we’re going to target--?

C.J.
I really don’t know what we’re going to target Sam. The commandant of the 2nd 
division doesn’t tend to include me in his thinking.

SAM
I’ll see you later.

C.J.
Count on it.

Sam exits into JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA. Sam walks down the hall and smashes his fist 
against a wall.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
The National Security team and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral 
PERCY FITZWALLACE, sit around a table.

FITZWALLACE
You know what I was thinking?

OFFICER
What’s that, Admiral?

FITZWALLACE
This is different coffee than we usually have.

The doors open, Bartlet and Leo enter. Everyone stands.

BARTLET
Keep your seats. [Everyone sits back down.]

FITZWALLACE
Good morning Mr. President.

BARTLET
What have we got?

FITZWALLACE
Three retaliatory strike scenarios.

LEO
When are they operational?

FITZWALLACE
At the President’s command.

LEO
No prep time?

GENERAL
We’re there.

FITZWALLACE
All three scenarios are comprehensive, meet the obligations of proportional 
response and pose minimal threat to U.S. personal and assets. To turn our attention 
to scenario one, or Pericles One, to use its code name...

BARTLET
What is the virtue of a proportional response?

FITZWALLACE
I’m sorry.

BARTLET
What’s the virtue of a proportional response? Why’s it good? [beat] They hit an 
airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That’s a proportional response.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, in the case of Pericles...

BARTLET
They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?

FITZWALLACE
That’s roughly it, sir.

BARTLET
It’s what we do. I mean this is what we do.

LEO
Yes sir, it’s what we do, it’s what we’ve always done.

BARTLET
Well, if it’s what we do, if it’s what we’ve always done, don’t they know we’re 
going to do it?

LEO
Sir, if you would turn your attention to Pericles One.

BARTLET
I have turned my attention to Pericles One, it’s two ammo dumps, an abandoned 
railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency.

FITZWALLACE
Those are four high rated military targets, sir.

BARTLET
But they know we’re going to do that, they know we’re going to do that. Those areas 
have been abandoned for four days. We know that from the satellites. We have the 
intelligence.

LEO
Sir.

BARTLET
They did that, so we did this, it’s the cost of doing business, it’s been factored 
in, right?

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Am I right or am I missing something here?

FITZWALLACE
No sir, you’re right sir.

BARTLET
Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?

FITZWALLACE
It isn’t virtuous Mr. President. It’s all there is sir.

BARTLET
It is not all there is.

LEO
Sir, Admiral Fitzwallace...

FITZWALLACE
Excuse me Leo, but pardon me Mr. President, just what else is there?

BARTLET
A disproportional response. Let the word ring forth from this time and this place, 
you kill an American, any American, we don’t come back with a proportional response, 
we come back [bangs fist on table] with total disaster!

GENERAL
Are you suggesting we carpet-bomb Damascus?

BARTLET
General, I am suggesting that you and Admiral Fitzwallace and Secretary Hutchinson 
and the rest of the national security team take the next sixty minutes and put 
together a U.S. response scenario that doesn’t make me think we are just docking 
somebody’s damn allowance! [gets up and leaves the room. Everyone stands.]

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
A nervous looking CHARLIE YOUNG stands and looks around the room. Donna and Josh 
are outside walking towards the room, you can hear faint echoes of banter.

JOSH [OS]
I haven’t eaten lunch yet, if anyone’s going to the thing.

DONNA [OS]
What do you want? [They appear in the doorway and walk in.]

JOSH
I would like a salad. I would like a soup of some kind and if you were to run across
a sandwich, then hang the expense.

DONNA
Right.

JOSH
And I would like a bottle of water.

DONNA
This is Charles Young. [hands him Charlie's file and leaves.]

JOSH
I’m supposed to vet you.

CHARLIE
I beg your pardon?

JOSH
I’m supposed to vet you, vet you; investigate to discover... if there are problems. 
I’m Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff.

CHARLIE
How are you?

JOSH
Is it Charles?

CHARLIE
Charlie.

JOSH
Charlie, you can have a seat if you like.

CHARLIE
I don’t mind standing.

Donna walks down the hall.

JOSH
Uh, Donna!

DONNA
[appears in the doorway] What?

JOSH
Never mind the salad, I’m not going to eat it anyway.

DONNA
Fine.

JOSH
But I would like a bottle of water as soon as humanly possible.

DONNA
Fine. [leaves]

JOSH
So... have a seat. [Charlie does.] I’m sure you understand why we have to go through 
this. It’s a very sensitive job. It’s also a very hard job. Twenty-hour days aren’t 
uncommon, long trips at the last minute, a lot of wait and hurry up. Moreover there 
will be times when you’ll have to make yourself invisible in plain sight, as well as 
an undeniable force in front of those who want more time than we’re willing to give. 
Sometimes the people I’m talking about will be kings and prime ministers, you 
understand so far? 

CHARLIE
Uh, sir, I’m sorry but I think there’s been some sort of mistake.

JOSH
Really?

CHARLIE
See, I came here, I filled out an application form...

JOSH
Yeah, I have your paperwork.

CHARLIE
Right, see, I came here, I was looking for a job as a messenger and I had an 
interview with Miss DiLaguardia and she told me to wait.

JOSH
Yes.

CHARLIE
And then she told me to come here.

JOSH
Yes, that’s because we asked Miss DiLaguardia to keep an eye out. She’s recommending 
you for a different job.

CHARLIE
Sir, if you don’t mind me asking--

JOSH
Personal aide to the President, and you don’t have to call me ‘Sir’.

CHARLIE
I don’t understand.

JOSH
Personal aide to the President, traditionally a young guy, 20 to 25 years old, 
excels academically, strong in personal responsibility and discretion, presentable 
appearance.

CHARLIE
Sir--

JOSH
We obviously get a lot of candidates that meet those qualifications, the rest is 
just gut instinct. [beat] Or you could bribe me.

CHARLIE
Uh, um, sir...

JOSH
Seriously Charlie, we call the President ‘Sir’ everyone else is ‘hey, when am I 
gonna get that thing I asked for?’

DONNA
[enters and hands Josh a bottle of water] Water.

CHARLIE
See, that’s not... see, there’s been some kind of mistake.

JOSH
[reading a report] I’ll say. Donna! [She stops at the door.]

CHARLIE
I should go. [stands]

JOSH
‘Insuccessful’?

DONNA
What’s the problem?

JOSH
I don’t think we’re allowed to make up our own words.

DONNA
Oh, and like there’s no chance it’s a typo.

JOSH
Change it, would you? Serious people are going to read that. [Donna takes the report 
and exits.]

JOSH
Charlie, you’re standing again.

CHARLIE
Well, see, I came here for a messenger job.

JOSH
Why aren’t you in college?

CHARLIE
Well, uh...

JOSH
These transcripts. Your grades are better than mine.

CHARLIE
Mr. Lyman.

JOSH
Well, no, not really, but they’re close.

CHARLIE
It was an easy school.

JOSH
No, come one, I’m looking at recommendations from guidance counselors, I’m looking 
at ACT scores. You didn’t want to go to college?

CHARLIE
Well, I have a little sister at home.

JOSH
You take care of her?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

JOSH
Your parents are gone?

CHARLIE
My mom, she’s a police officer. She was shot and killed on duty a few months ago. 
Five months ago.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Bartlet walks in and sits down.

BARTLET
Keep your seats. There’s a delegation of cardiologists having their pictures taken 
in the Blue Room. You wouldn’t think you could find a group of people more arrogant 
than the fifteen of us, but there they are right upstairs in the Blue Room. You 
called me?

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir. Mr. President we put together a scenario by which we attack Hassan 
airport. Its three main terminals and two runway. In addition to the civilian 
causalities, which could register in the thousands, the strike would temporally 
cripple the region’s ability to receive medical supplies and bottled water. I think 
Mr. Cashmen and Secretary Hutchinson would each tell you what I’m sure you already 
know sir. That this strike would be seen at home and abroad as a staggering 
overreaction by a first time Commander in Chief. That without the support of our 
allies, without a Western Coalition, without Great Britain and Japan and without 
Congress, you’ll have doled out a five thousand dollar punishment for a fifty buck 
crime sir. Mr. President, the proportional response doesn’t empty the options box 
for the future, the way an all out assault--

BARTLET
[waves him off] Thank you. [beat] Does anyone have a cigarette?

An officer pulls out a pack and a lighter and slides it towards the President. 
Bartlet pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

BARTLET [cont.]
This other plan...

FITZWALLACE
Pericles One.

BARTLET
Pericles One. No civilian causalities?

FITZWALLACE
We can’t promise that.

BARTLET
But you’re as certain as you can be?

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And what are the military implications?

OFFICER 2
We’ll cripple both their intelligence network and their surface to air strike 
capabilities.

BARTLET
Very well. [pause, to Leo] How does this work?

FITZWALLACE
You give me the go order sir.

An officer moves over to the phone. Bartlet sighs. Pause.

FITZWALLACE
Mr. President? [Bartlet nods.] This is Fitzwallace, I have a go order from the 
President. Start the clock on Pericles One. Stand by for confirmation code.

OFFICER
We’re underway.

Bartlet throws his cigarette in a glass of water. He gets up and is standing in 
the doorway.

FITZWALLACE
Well done.

BARTLET
Fifty buck crime. [to Leo] I honestly don’t know what the hell we’re doing here.
[leaves]

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Charlie and Josh are sitting at the table. Josh has a bunch of paperwork in front 
of him.

JOSH
Charlie, I’ve got some questions here for you from the Council’s office, as well as 
the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Internal Security. These questions 
are all routine, there’s no cause for concern. Ready?

CHARLIE
Mr. Lyman--

JOSH
‘Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?’

CHARLIE
Is it because the messenger job is not available anymore? Because maybe if I came 
back at a different time.

JOSH
Charlie, this job’s actually better than the messenger job. It pays more, you don’t 
have to ride around town on a bicycle and instead of being a messenger, you get to 
be personal aide to the President.

CHARLIE
I see. So, maybe if I come--

Sam knocks on the door and walks in.

JOSH
Hey, Sam. This is Sam Seaborn, he’s deputy communications director. This is Charlie 
Young. He’s here for Ted’s job.

SAM
It’s nice to meet you, don’t get up.

CHARLIE
Um, I was here for the messenger job.

SAM
Debbie’s got an eye for personnel.

CHARLIE
I’ve got a driver’s license and my own bike so...

JOSH
I gotta ask you some more questions...

SAM
Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?

CHARLIE
No sir.

SAM
What the hell’s been stopping you? [Josh and Sam laugh.]

JOSH
Seriously Charlie, I have to ask you about your personal life.

SAM
No, you don’t.

JOSH
Yes, I do.

SAM
Why?

JOSH
Because I do.

SAM
Charlie, are you gonna come to work early, stay late, do your job efficiently and 
discretely?

CHARLIE
As I was saying to Mr. Lyman--

SAM
Thank you. What more do you need to know?

JOSH
Charlie, I wonder if you could tell me about your social life, your friends, what 
you like to do?

SAM
Josh, I cannot believe you.

CHARLIE
Well, uh, there’s my sister Deena and uh, I’m not sure what you’re asking.

SAM
He’s asking if you’re gay, Charlie, and I wouldn’t answer the damn question.

JOSH
All right, that’s it Sam, let’s take a walk. [gets up]

SAM
You know what, feel free to sue our asses off. I’ll represent you.

JOSH
Let’s go.

Josh leads Sam out of the room and into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
What the hell was that about?

SAM
This is ridiculous.

JOSH
It’s not all that ridiculous.

SAM
I know the difference between right and wrong.

JOSH
It’s not like you didn’t know you’d be held to a high standard when you took this job.

SAM
I don’t mind being held to a higher standard, I mind being held to a lower one.

JOSH
I gotta say Sam, digging your heels in...

SAM
I was just talking.

JOSH
I understand...

SAM
‘Digging my heels in’? Another word for that would be principle?

JOSH
I’m just saying!

Toby walks in between them on his way to Leo's office.

TOBY
Leo’s office.

JOSH & SAM
What?

TOBY
It’s happening.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’s OFFICE - DAY
Margaret walks in, C.J. is already inside.

MARGARET
He’s right here.

Sam, Josh and Toby walk in.

SAM
It’s happening?

C.J.
Yeah, that’s what I hear.

LEO
[walks in] The order was given at 16:27, codename Pericles One. Four targets, all 
military. Two munitions dumps in Northern Rishan, Southian bridge and an IHQ.

C.J.
What’s the estimated time?

LEO
About 6:30 Eastern, you can come to the Sit Room in twenty minutes for a weapons 
briefing. In the meantime, Toby, Sam, the President will go on network at nine, so 
start zeroing in. [Toby, Sam, and C.J. start to leave.] Hey guys, no phone calls in 
or out. C.J., nothing to the press until you get the high sign from me. No head starts.

Sam and Toby leave.

C.J.
They’re gonna wonder what all the fuss is about.

LEO
Then let’s not have any fuss.

C.J.
I could use a few minutes with the President at some point.

LEO
You and me both.

C.J.
I’m not kidding Leo, this is the...

LEO
You’ll be there.

C.J.
This is the first...

LEO
You’ll be there.

C.J.
He’ll talk to me?

LEO
Yes.

C.J. leaves. Josh is standing at the back of the room.

JOSH
How you doing?

LEO
Fine.

JOSH
Leo, Toby says he’s snapping at the First...

LEO
Not now Josh. I mean, you’re right, but not now. [beat] Margaret!

JOSH
Hey Leo, can I ask you a question?

LEO
What?

JOSH
I’m interviewing this kid for Ted Miller’s job, and he’s a real special kid. He’s
applied himself in school, I’m sure he’d be articulate if he wasn’t terrified. He’s 
postponing college until his sister gets out of high school.

LEO
Where are the parents?

JOSH
Father’s long gone. His mother was a uniformed cop here in D.C.

LEO
Was?

JOSH
She was shot and killed in the line five months ago. [beat] I really like him Leo. 
I want to hire him.

LEO
What’s the problem?

JOSH
He’s black.

LEO
So’s the Attorney General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs?

JOSH
They don’t hold the door open for the President.

LEO
What are you worried...?

JOSH
I’m not wild about the visual. A young black man holding his overnight bag?

LEO
Josh, I hold the door open for the President, it’s an honor. This is serious business 
Josh. This isn’t casting. We get the guy for the job and we take it from there.

JOSH
Good.

LEO
And I’m fairly sure I’m right about this.

JOSH
Yeah. Good. [beat] Two hours?

LEO
Uh, a little less.

MARGARET
[enters] Chairman Fitzwallace.

LEO
Send him in.

JOSH
We’ll be fine.

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
[enters] Oh, things have moved since I was in this office last.

JOSH
How are you Admiral? [reaches to shake hands] Josh Lyman.

FITZWALLACE
Josh, you don’t have to introduce yourself, and I’m fine thanks.

JOSH
Tough day.

FITZWALLACE
It’ll be a lot tougher on them than on us.

JOSH
Good. [exits]

FITZWALLACE
You’re gonna have to set him down Leo.

LEO
I know.

FITZWALLACE
He’s gonna have to talk to the country a little bit. This is not the last one of 
these we’re gonna have to do, but you’re gonna have to set him down.

LEO
Any advice?

FITZWALLACE
It’s not my place.

LEO
Yeah, it is.

FITZWALLACE
Tell him it’s always like this the first time. Tell him he’s doing fine.

LEO
He’s not doing fine.

FITZWALLACE
Yeah, he is. Presidents don’t make new friends, that’s why they gotta keep their 
old ones. You’ll know what to say. [starts to leave]

LEO
Yeah. [beat] Uh, hey Fitz?

FITZWALLACE
Yeah?

LEO
The President’s personal aide, they’re looking at a kid. Do you have any problem 
with a young black man waiting on the President? 

FITZWALLACE
I’m an old black man and I wait on the President.

LEO
The kid’s gotta carry his bags...

FITZWALLACE
You gonna pay him a decent wage?

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
You gonna treat him with respect in the workplace?

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
Then why the hell should I care?

LEO
That’s what I thought.

FITZWALLACE
I’ve got some real honest to God battles to fight Leo. I don’t have time for the 
cosmetic ones.

LEO
Thanks Admiral. Good luck.

FITZWALLACE
See you later. 

The admiral exits into the HALLWAY with an officer. Toby is walking by, his arms are 
full of papers and files.

FITZWALLACE
Evening Toby.

TOBY
Evening sir. Sorry I can’t stop...

FITZWALLACE
Go. [walks off]

Toby walks into the ROOSEVELT ROOM. Staffers walk frantically in and out. Ginger 
walks in. Josh stands in front of the table.

GINGER
Estimated BDA?

TOBY
It’s my first bombing, I don’t know yet. [Ginger exits.]

JOSH
Toby, you need help with anything because...

TOBY
No! [exits]

JOSH
Sheila, if you need me for anything... Standing here with absolutely nothing to do.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN - DAY
Staffers continue to wander around frantically. Toby walks in and into his office. 
Cathy is standing at her desk. The phone rings.

CATHY
White House Communications, I’m sorry Toby’s not available to speak on the phone 
at the moment. No, Sam’s not available either. [C.J. enters.] Why isn’t anyone 
available to speak on the phone?

C.J.
I don’t know, they’re planning my surprise party.

C.J. stands in the doorway of TOBY’s OFFICE. Toby and Sam are writing.

SAM
Unprovoked and cold-blooded.

TOBY
It’s needs a third.

C.J.
Toby?

TOBY
Quickly.

C.J.
The AGM 84 Islam.

TOBY
Cathy! Sam cut the paragraph ten minutes ago.

CATHY
[while walking across the bullpen] It’s coming out on the redline.

C.J.
The 84 Islam?

TOBY
Standoff land attack missile. Distinguish it from the AGM 84D or Harpoon, which is 
an anti-shive missile.

C.J.
Thank you. [leaves]

TOBY
The third thing?

SAM
Unwarranted, unprovoked...

TOBY
And cold-blooded. Unwarranted.

SAM
Unprovoked.

TOBY
And cold-blooded. Great.

SAM
[gets up and walks away] I just need a...

TOBY
Where you going?

SAM
Two seconds. Just two seconds. [Sam walks through the office into the HALLWAY 
where C.J. is standing.] C.J., listen.

C.J.
What?

SAM
I’m sorry about before.

C.J.
Yeah.

SAM
I’m just really very fond of her is all.

C.J.
Go back to work.

SAM
Right.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - NIGHT
C.J. is walking through the lobby into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. A gaggle of reporters 
is standing at the door to the PRESS ROOM.

CHRIS
C.J., what’s all the activity?

C.J.
What activity?

REPORTER
Fitzwallace was in Leo’s office.

C.J.
[starts walking slowly towards her office] Admiral Fitzwallace is Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, Leo McGarry is White House chief of staff, I’m your host C.J., let’s 
play our game.

CHRIS
Is it happening?

C.J.
No.

CHRIS
Would you know if it was?

C.J.
Guys.

REPORTER
Why all the activity?

C.J. 
Menudo’s in the building. I gotta go.

The reporters once again walk away upset. C.J. heads towards her office. A reporter,
DANNY CONCANNON, stands by her door.

C.J.
Oh man. I’d honestly think that you of all people.

DANNY
We need to talk.

C.J.
Danny, I haven’t called a full lid, they’ll obviously be a briefing if the President 
has engaged the use of military force.

DANNY
Thanks. Since I’ve only been a White House reporter for seven years, I appreciate 
you clearing that up.
 
C.J.
[beat] What?

DANNY
Not for nothing, but I know Sam Seaborn’s been going around with a three thousand 
dollar a night call girl. And I thought you should know that I know. [beat] Ask me 
inside, C.J.

C.J.
Inside.

They walk into her office and close the door.
FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Josh walks down the hallway, leans on a wall near Donna's desk.

JOSH
Where’s Charlie?

DONNA
He’s filling out his employment stuff at Personnel.

JOSH
How’s he doing?

DONNA
He looked pretty freaked.

JOSH
He’s a gamer. I can pick ‘em.

DONNA
If you say so.

Pause. Josh looks around, whistles a little bit, and generally looks bored.

JOSH
I’ve got nothing to do.

DONNA
I can see that.

A staffers runs up, grabs something from near where Josh is standing and runs off.

JOSH
Woo! Excuse me. Everyone’s running around like the future of the world depends on it, 
which I suppose it does, everyone running around, working. Me, I’ve got nothing to do.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I’m like a writer on a movie set.

DONNA
Have you ever been on a movie set?

JOSH
No, but I hear stories.

DONNA
You wanna do mail?

JOSH
[sitting down] I suppose there’s some comfort in knowing that whatever’s going to 
happen today has already happened.

MANDY [walks out of Josh's office]
Josh, your office sucks.

JOSH
I don’t understand it. Why can’t you tell me when there’s someone in my office?

DONNA
The first time I didn’t know, the second time I didn’t care that much. [gets up and 
leaves]

MANDY
I mean it, it’s a hole.

JOSH
[gets up and walks toward her and his office] Why are you here?

MANDY
I start work next week, I came to get psyched.

JOSH’S OFFICE. They both enter.

JOSH
You picked a really bad time to get psyched.

MANDY
Because the President gave the attack order and you’re getting ready to go on the air?

JOSH
No, it’s because--

MANDY
Please Josh, everyone’s running around looking casual, Toby and Sam are locked in 
with the speechwriters and you’ve got nothing to do. What is it? An IHQ and a couple 
of armories?

JOSH
You wanna say it a bit louder Mandy, I don’t Syrian Air Defense Command heard you.

MANDY
I brought you a present.

JOSH
Why are you being nice to me? [sits behind his desk]

MANDY
Cause I’m really psyched to get started work. 

JOSH
It’s been pretty bad around here since it happened.

MANDY
I had a hunch.

JOSH
The combination of American lives and Morris, the idea of using any force at all.

MANDY
We always said he’d be in his head.

JOSH
He wasn’t ready for it.

MANDY
How do you get ready for it?

JOSH
What did you bring me?

MANDY
What?

JOSH
I want my present.

MANDY
Yeah. [grabs something out of her bag and gives it to Josh] It’s a picture I found.

JOSH
It’s a picture of you and me and someone’s drawn all over my face with magic marker.

MANDY
That was me.

JOSH
Ah.

MANDY
During my period of hating you.

JOSH
Well, that could have been pretty much any time, couldn’t it?

MANDY
Sure. [starts walking around Josh’s desk, towards him] This was taken the night we 
met. At that seafood place by the Democratic Leadership Conference. 

JOSH
Look at that.

MANDY
You couldn’t stop staring at me.

JOSH
Well, you were wearing quite the ensemble that night Madeline.

MANDY
[sits on the edge of his desk] I don’t think it was the wardrobe you were staring 
at there, Lucky. [Josh laughs.] You guys are doing okay, Josh.

The phone rings. Josh picks it up.

JOSH
Yeah... yeah. [hangs up] They found a job for me.

MANDY
I’ll see you next week.

JOSH
Listen, you’re not gonna be this nice to me when we’re working together, right?

MANDY
Not a chance. [leaves]

JOSH
That’s what I thought. [puts the picture on his desk. Donna walks in.] Hey. What’s up?

Donna and Josh exit.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Danny and C.J. are sitting across from each other at her desk.

DANNY
I obviously don’t have enough for a story, but as a courtesy to you C.J. I just 
wanted to let you know I’m gonna be asking around.

C.J.
Danny, it’s gonna be much ado about nothing.

DANNY
It doesn’t look that way.

C.J.
But it is that way and I just got through telling you it’s that way.

DANNY
C.J.

C.J.
Sam knows the difference between right and wrong and so do you. Would it make my 
life easier if he wasn’t friends with this woman? Absolutely. But Sam is a grown up 
and I don’t get to choose his friends and your readers don’t get to judge them. And 
I’ll tell you what else, there’s something commendable about Sam’s behavior here, 
don’t ask me what but there is, and I’m stickin’ by him until the President orders 
me otherwise and I’m going to look very unfavorably on those who seek only to make 
us look like fools.

DANNY
Whoa. Down girl. I’ll drop it.

C.J.
Good.

DANNY
I’ll drop it.

C.J.
Thank you.

DANNY
But C.J. you better get D’ed up here. Because not everyone’s a good guy and you’re 
gonna start to get traction on something that not everyone’s a fan of and they’re 
gonna put a tail on Seaborn, if they haven’t already. Remember, I found out about 
this somehow and I wasn’t there.

C.J.
I don’t supposed you’d tell me...

DANNY
No way. My point is, they’ll keep it in their pocket until the eve of something big. 
Bill signing, State of the Union, maybe the convention.

The phone rings. C.J. answers.

C.J.
Yeah. I’ll wait for him. [to Danny] Hang on, I’m gonna give you a ten minute head 
start on something.

DANNY
What for?

C.J.
For being a good guy.

DANNY
What’s the tip?

C.J.
[into phone] Yeah, thank you. [hangs up] We’re out of Syrian air space.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Josh is giving Charlie the tour. They’re walking towards the Oval Office.

JOSH
This used to be the White House Council’s office ‘til Toby and the Communications 
staff conquered and pillaged. The Map Room. Roosevelt Room. Oval Office. Chief of 
Staff. I guess the only thing left to do is to say hello to the President.

Charlie stops walking.

JOSH
We’re going on the air in a few minutes with a national address so I don’t know how 
much... where the hell’d he go? [beat] Charlie.

Josh motions for Charlie to come into the Oval Office. 

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet, Toby and Sam all walk in the room towards the desk. Staffers are still 
walking around frantically, they are joined by a crew of cameramen, gaffers and 
stage managers. There are television monitors in the room and extra lights.

BARTLET
What happened to paragraph nine?

SAM
In the red line sir.

BARTLET
I’m sorry, paragraph eight.

SAM
We cut that half an hour ago.

TOBY
You have to read between the lines.

BARTLET
Well, I want to see it again.

TOBY
You should look at the new paragraph.

BARTLET
I can’t look at anything fellas. Mrs. Landingham! I need my glasses!

NANCY
Sir, she’s talking to the porters right now.

TOBY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
When do we get the BDA?

TOBY
Uh.

SAM
There’s a problem with that sir.

BARTLET
Why!?

TOBY
Ordinarily we get help from inside the Syrian Intelligence.

Josh and Charlie enter.

BARTLET
So what’s the problem?

TOBY
We just blew up the Syrian Intelligence.

BARTLET
Oh, for crying out loud, will somebody get on the phone to CNN and find out if we 
hit anything!

STAFFER
Mr. President, it’s the BDA sir. [hands Bartlet a report]

BARTLET
Thank you! Now if I had my glasses.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[enters with Nancy] The porters have searched your bedroom from top to bottom.

BARTLET
This has been since this morning, we could have brought in an optometrist by now.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
An optometrist can’t fold his equipment into a briefcase.

NANCY
They have those machines with the lenses.

BARTLET
I don’t need an optometrist now, thank you Nancy. I just need to glasses he 
prescribed.

C.J.
[enters] Mr. President, if you’ll take a minute or two to familiarize yourself with 
the phoenix.

BARTLET
I got the briefing on the phoenix.

C.J.
You understand that I’m not talking about the sidewinder.

BARTLET
The phoenix. I got the briefing on the phoenix last night, I studied the report, 
Hutchinson was there, in my private study. 

Charlie whispers something to Josh, who are farther away from all the action.

BARTLET [cont.]
The phoenix, the A61, the sparrow, and the sidewinder. Are we covered?

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Very well.

DIRECTOR
Ten minutes to air Mr. President.

JOSH
Tell him.

BARTLET
For want of a pair of glasses.

C.J.
Try mine sir.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[outside] We’re looking.

NANCY
[also outside] She’s looking.

BARTLET
Thank you. [tries on C.J.’s glasses]

TOBY
While they’re looking sir, in the meantime can you take a look at the new paragraph?

BARTLET
Aw, crap. I can’t see anything with those.

JOSH
Charlie, tell him.

CHARLIE
Mr. President... [Everyone stops to look.] You said you read the phoenix report...

BARTLET
What!?

CHARLIE
You said you read the phoenix report in your private study last night, sir.

BARTLET
What of it? Who is this?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[to Nancy] Have a steward go the President’s study. Have him look under the papers 
on the coffee table. [Nancy nods and exits.]

JOSH
Mr. President, this is Charles Young...

BARTLET
I don’t have anytime for new people now!

LEO
Alright, that’s it. [beat] Excuse me, Mr. President, a minute please.

Charlie walks out of the room. Bartlet and Leo head towards Leo’s office. Toby 
flashes Leo a ten-minute sign with his hands. Leo nods.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’s OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks around and closes all the doors while he’s talking.

BARTLET
What do you need, Leo?

LEO
Well, you’ve gone through everyone who works for you and everyone who’s married to 
you. I didn’t know who else you could get mad at, so I was afraid the American 
people might be next. Oh, by the way, when we’re done here you’re sending Abby 
some flowers.

BARTLET
[pause] Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across 
the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across 
the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words ‘Civis Romanis’ I am a Roman citizen. 
So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any 
harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris’ protection, or anyone else 
on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to 
the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the 
clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes 
crashing down on your house!? In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?

LEO
We are behaving the way a superpower ought to behave.

BARTLET
Well our behavior has produced some pretty crappy results. In fact, I’m not a 
hundred percent sure it hasn’t induced them.

LEO
What are you talking about?

BARTLET
I’m talking about two hundred and eight-six American marines in Beirut, I’m talking 
about Somalia, I’m talking about Nairobi.

LEO
And you think ratching up the body count’s gonna act as a deterrent?

BARTLET
You’re damn right.

LEO
Then you are just as dumb as these guys who think that capital punishment is going 
to be a deterrent for drug kingpins. As if drug kingpins didn’t live their day to 
day lives under the possibility of execution. And their executions are a lot less 
dainty than ours and tend to take place without the bother and expense of due 
process. So my friend, if you want to start using American military strength as the 
arm of the Lord, you can do that, we’re the only superpower left. You can conquer 
the world, like Charlemenge, but you better be prepared to kill everyone and you 
better start with me cause I will raise up an army against you and I will beat you!

BARTLET
He had a ten-day-old baby at home.

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
We are doing nothing. They dest...

LEO
We are not doing nothing. Four high rated military targets.

BARTLET
And this is good?

LEO
Of course it’s not good, there is no good. It’s what there is. It’s how you behave 
if you’re the most powerful nation in the world. It’s proportional, it’s reasonable,
 it’s responsible, it’s merciful. It’s not nothing, four high rated military targets.

BARTLET
Which they’ll rebuild again in six months.

LEO
So we’ll blow ‘em up again in six months! We’re getting really good at it. [beat]
It’s what our fathers taught us.

BARTLET
Why didn’t you say so? [beat] Oh man Leo. When I think of all the work you put in 
to get me to run. [both sit] When I think of all the work you did to get me elected. 
I could pommel your ass with a baseball bat. 

They laugh.

LEO
Oh, here’s one you’ll like. Bertram Coles--

BARTLET
Oh, I like anything that starts with ‘Bertram Coles’. Let’s have it.

LEO
Coles goes on the radio yesterday and he says people in his district love America 
and you better not come down there cause you might not get out alive. [laughs]

BARTLET
Bert’s calling me out?

LEO
Apparently, the people in Bert’s district are so patriotic that if the President 
of the United States himself were to show up, they’d kill him.

They both laugh.

BARTLET
Ziegler must be ballistic.

LEO
Toby is on it.

BARTLET
Oh, by the way, who was that kid before? The one who figured out where my glasses are?

LEO
Well, if you want him, that’s your new body man.

BARTLET
What’s his story?

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Outside the Oval Office, Charlie stands in the hall. Josh walks out to meet him.

JOSH
This was just, I think, a bad day. I have to tell you, he’s ordinarily an extremely 
kind man placing a very high premium on civility. Today, it’s just been a difficult 
few days for him.

CHARLIE
I think I should probably go.

BARTLET
[appears in the doorway] Excuse me Charlie. Can I see you inside please? Come on, 
it’s okay. 

Charlie, Bartlet and Josh all enter THE OVAL OFFICE. 

BARTLET [CONT]
I’m Jed Bartlet.

CHARLIE
I’m Charles Young.

BARTLET
But you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation 
with your mother, I’m so very sorry. I hope you don’t mind but I took the liberty 
of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director. We had the computer spit out some quick 
information, you’re mother was killed by a Western .38 Revolver firing K.T.W.s, or 
what are known as ‘Cop Killer bullets’, now we have not had a whole lot of success 
banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we’re planning on taking 
a big whack at it when Congress gets back from recess. So, what do you say, you 
wanna come help us out?

CHARLIE
Yes sir, I do.

BARTLET
Thanks.

Bartlet and Charlie shake hands.

DIRECTOR
Thirty seconds please!

LEO
All set?

Bartlet is standing in front of his desk, Leo in front of it. Everyone else is 
behind the camera and monitors.

BARTLET
You tell me.

LEO
That’s a pretty ugly tie.

BARTLET
My granddaughter gave me this tie.

LEO
So, my nephew gave me an ashtray he made at summer camp.

BARTLET
Get away from me. Somebody throw this guy out of the building!

DIRECTOR
Stand by.

Bartlet sits. Leo moves back with the rest. Charlie and the senior staff are 
standing around one monitor.

CHARLIE
I’ve never felt like this before.

JOSH
It doesn’t go away.

NEWSCASTER
[on monitor] Here now, the President.

BARTLET
My fellow Americans, good evening. A short while ago I ordered our Armed Forces to 
attack and destroy four military targets in Northern Syria, this in response to the 
unwarranted, unprovoked...

DISSOLVE TO:
END TITLES.

BARTLET [cont.]
...and cold-blooded downing three days ago of an unarmed Air Force jet carrying 58
passengers and the flag of the United States.

FADE TO BLACK.

West Wing S01E04
Presidential Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) needs five more House votes to pass a bill restricting the sale of automatic firearms -- but the cost might be too high, especially if he has to go to the unpredictable Vice President (Tim Matheson) to help put them over the top. The staff's annual financial disclosure statements prove to be thorny for Toby (Richard Schiff), whose innocent technology stock purchase last year proved to be wildly profitable, which raises eyes due to his association with an expert in the field. In addition, Leo's long hours on the job cause an unforeseen crisis at home, and the President (Martin Sheen) unintentionally mixes up the potent medications he receives for his ailing back.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
MONDAY NIGHT
Bartlet is speaking at a dinner. He stands behind the podium while important people
in fancy clothes listen to him. Hanging behind him is a banner that says “Practical 
Idealism”.

BARTLET
One night he went in and set the briefcase down and said, “Bess, why do you suppose 
it is that only sons-of-bitches know how to lick a stamp?” [laughter and applause]
The point is, friends, you’ve got to write the letter, you’ve got to send a fax, 
you’ve got to pick up the phone and call Western Union. You’ve got to contact your 
Congressional representative...

Backstage, Leo is watching the speech as his phone rings. He answers it, while 
Bartlet continues in the background.

BARTLET
You’ve got to say “Mister, I’ve got a friend who’s neighbor is dead...

LEO
McGarry here.

BARTLET
“...Madam, I’ve got a neighbor whose friend is dead, whose husband is dead, whose 
mother is dead, kids are dead! Kids are dead!

LEO
What are you talking about?

BARTLET
“...and I wanna know, mister. I wanna know, madam...

LEO
How did it happen?

BARTLET
...how you intend to vote on Wednesday, so that I’ll know how to vote next election...”

LEO
Well how did the wheels come off this thing?

BARTLET
You gotta ask ‘em. You gotta ask ‘em! [Applause. Josh joins Leo backstage.]

LEO
We lost five votes.

JOSH
What?

LEO
We lost five votes.

JOSH
Give me names.

LEO
I don’t got them yet. Get on the phone.

JOSH
[groans]Oh, man!

JOSH gets on the phone. Somewhere backstage, Toby is watching the Bartlet on a 
T.V. screen.

BARTLET
You know, I had a civil procedure professor who said once...

TOBY
Take a beat. [pause] There you go.

BARTLET
He said, “When the law is on your side, argue the law; and when the facts are on 
your side, argue the facts...

Leo and Josh are both talking on their phones, with Bartlet on T.V. screens in the 
background.

LEO
But it’s not in cement.

BARTLET
...When you don’t have the law on your side, when you don’t have the facts on your 
side, bang your fist on the defense table as loud as you can.” Well, we’ve got the 
law on our side now, and we’ve got the facts on our side now...

JOSH
Yeah, this is Josh Lyman. Please call me. I need to know what happened.

BARTLET
...bang our fist on the defense table, but we’re not listening any more. We’re not 
having that any more. We’re gonna win on Wednesday. We’re gonna win on Wednesday! 
Thank you all. [The crowd stands up and applauds.] God bless you, and God bless America!

Bartlet works his way out of the room while “Happy Days Are Here Again” plays. The 
staff follows as they all walk through the back hallways. Sam shakes Bartlet's hand.

SAM 
Fantastic.

BARTLET 
Thank you.

Bartlet continues down the hall with his Secret Service AGENTS. Sam joins Toby as they 
continue to follow the President.

SAM 
Good job.

TOBY
[unenthusiastic] Yeah.

SAM
You didn’t like it.

TOBY
I thought it was fine.

SAM
I thought it was a hell of a lot better than fine. 

TOBY
[still unenthusiastic] It was good.

SAM
It was outstanding!

TOBY
He blew the D section.

SAM
Toby, they’re still on their feet cheering.

TOBY
Yeah, I said it was fine.

C.J.
[walks up] Sam, nice going.

SAM
Thank you. Tell him. [indicates Toby]

C.J.
Why?

SAM
Well-

TOBY
Because Sam wrote two and a half paragraphs and I wrote thirty-seven pages.

C.J.
Still...

TOBY
He blew the D section.

C.J.
I thought it was inspired.

TOBY
Why do you keep saying stuff like that to me?

C.J.
[laughing] Just to watch your face turn that color. [They all go down the stairs.]

JOSH 
[from behind] C.J.!

C.J.
[drops back] Hey, your little fan club was out in full force tonight.

JOSH
Well, they like me in my tux.

C.J.
Do you think I have an unusually large neck?

JOSH
What the hell?

C.J.
I’m just asking, ‘cause one of the...

JOSH
Stop talking.

C.J.
What’s up?

JOSH
I want you to look calm while I’m telling you this. 

C.J.
Telling me what?

JOSH
We lost five.

C.J.
What do you mean?

JOSH
802. Five votes jumped the fence.

C.J.
[going buggy eyed] Are you kidding me?

JOSH
Nice job looking calm.

C.J.
Are you kidding me?

JOSH
Leo just got off the phone with the whip. Last nose count, we’re five votes down.

C.J.
What the hell happened?

JOSH
We don’t know.

C.J.
Give me names.

JOSH
We’re finding out.

LEO
[from behind] Josh.

JOSH
Yeah?

SAM
[walks ahead to Mandy] Hi there.

MANDY
Hi.

SAM
“Happy Days Are Here Again”?

MANDY
He likes it.

SAM
Who?

MANDY
The President.

SAM
We try and avoid having the President make aesthetic decisions.

MANDY
I made the decision.

SAM
Right. And I don’t mean to step on your toes, but you might want to rethink marrying
the lines “Kids are dead. Kids are dead!” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.”

MANDY
It’s optimistic.

SAM
I’ll say.

Bartlet is shaking hands with someone, and then joins the group.
They go down the stairs again.

BARTLET
Thank you. Good night. [to Toby, in front of him] Toby!

TOBY
Sir.

BARTLET
What’d you think?

TOBY
I thought my work was outstanding, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
I thought you would.

TOBY
Thanks for asking. [pause] Couldn’t help but notice you got a little extemporaneous 
there in the D section. 

BARTLET
Oh, you noticed that, did you?

TOBY
Yes sir, I did.

BARTLET
Yes. I did a little polish right up there on my feet.

TOBY
Yes indeed.

BARTLET
Right in front of everybody. I looked to the side at one point, you know. I half 
expected to see you coming at me with a salad fork.

TOBY
Well, but for the secret service agents restraining me, sir.

BARTLET
Yup. Thank God for the secret service.

TOBY
Bless their hearts...

BARTLET
[sees a couple getting friendly in the hall] Hey there, fella. She deserves a nice 
room and some supper.

TOBY
You like doing that, don’t you sir?

BARTLET
[smiles] Yeah. [Toby laughs.] Hey, Charlie!

CHARLIE
[comes forward] Yes, sir?

BARTLET
What’d you think of the speech?

CHARLIE
Me?

BARTLET
Yes, you.

CHARLIE
Uh, I thought it was-

TOBY
He means the text of the speech, Charlie, discounting the little improv in the 
D section.

BARTLET
I mean the entire speech, Charlie, and in particular the delivery.

CHARLIE
I thought it was excellent.

BARTLET and TOBY
See! 

Toby laughs again.

BARTLET
See, I think what Charlie’s trying to say is that in this case the singer 
outdistanced the song.

TOBY
Really. Well, what I heard Charlie say was that the text was user-proof, although 
you did your level best to disprove that in the D section.

BARTLET
You know what, Toby?

TOBY
Sir.

BARTLET
You’re what my mother calls a pain in the ass.

TOBY
Well, that’s what my mother calls it too, sir.

CHARLIE
Oh, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yes, Charlie. By the way, did the First Lady call? 

CHARLIE
The First Lady called at eight forty, sir. She wished you luck and told me to tell 
you to take your back medicine.

BARTLET
My back is fine.

CHARLIE
I have it here, sir.

BARTLET
Those damn things make me goofy.

CHARLIE
Mrs. Bartlet seemed quite adamant. I’d describe her tone as being...

BARTLET
You don’t have to describe her tone to me, Charlie. I’ve been married to it for 
32 years.

The whole group comes out of building where a crowd is waiting for them. They head 
for their cars. Secret Service Agents are everywhere.

CHARLIE
Sir, I don’t want to get in trouble with the First Lady...

BARTLET
Give me the medicine, Charlie. [takes the medicine and sticks it in his pocket]
Thank you. Have a good night. I’ll see you in the morning.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[to the crowd] Thank you all.

Bartlet waves to the crowd and gets into his limousine, as Josh and C.J. walk by 
towards another car.

GIRLS IN THE CROWD
We love you, Josh!

JOSH
Thanks!

C.J.
[to girls] It helps not to know him!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
[into radio while tapping the car] Here we go. Move it out.

The car engines start.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

Sam, Toby, Mandy, and C.J. are sitting around a table, still in their fancy clothes,
 eating Chinese food. Leo and Josh are both on the phone.

C.J.
Leo, your food’s getting cold. Want me to bring it over? 

Leo shakes his head and continues talking on the phone.
 
MANDY
Seriously, I have never had dumplings quite this good.

JOSH
[plaintively] Isn’t my food getting cold too? 

C.J.
We ate your food.

MANDY
C.J., you have got to try this.

C.J.
Oh thanks. Try some of this.

TOBY
[under his breath] Here it comes.

C.J.
Yum! Oh, Sam, you gotta try the General Chow’s chicken.

MANDY
And the Kung Pow chicken.

C.J.
With the sauce. [offers the food. Sam takes a taste.]

MANDY
Oh, you gotta have it with the sauce.

SAM
[with mouth full] That’s delicious!

C.J.
You didn’t try it with the sauce.

TOBY
Will the two of you... shut up?

MANDY 
[to Toby] Wanna try the spicy crispy beef?

TOBY
I’m really very happy with the food that I’ve got.

Leo gets off the phone and walks over to the table. He starts dishing up.

C.J.
Botrell?

LEO
It’s not Botrell. I’ve only got two, but Botrell isn’t one of them. Katzenmoyer 
and Wick.

MANDY
I could’ve called that.

LEO
Sam, slide me a soda please.

Sam slides a soda to Leo. Josh hangs up his phone and walks over to the table. 
He has ditched his jacket and untied his bow tie.

JOSH
Everyone’s someplace else. All I got was O’Bannon. 

LEO
I didn’t get O’Bannon. That’s three.

JOSH
Who’d you get?

SAM
Katzenmoyer and Christopher Wick.

JOSH
Chris Wick?

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
It’s got to be a mistake. Who told you that?

LEO
Lee Tamaki and the minority whip.

JOSH
They’ve got bad information. There is no way Chris Wick jumped the fence.

LEO
The President just told a ballroom full of people and anyone who reads a newspaper 
that we’re gonna pass 802 on Wednesday. We’ve got a 72 hour fight.

TOBY
How do we do that without making noise?

MANDY
What do we care about noise?

LEO
There’s two things in the world you never want to let people see how you make ‘em: 
laws and sausages.

MANDY
Got it. First of all, obviously don’t involve the President.

LEO
Absolutely. This is us. [pause] C.J., what’s the press room going to be talking 
about in the next few days?

C.J.
Financial disclosures.

TOBY
That time again?

C.J.
It’s that time again.

JOSH
What are you worth there, Toby?

TOBY
[dryly] Well, I own this tuxedo, and I’ve got twenty-three bucks in my pocket.

MANDY
[giggles] That’s good.

LEO
Financial disclosure it is.

MANDY
No, I mean, that’s good.

JOSH
She’s right.

MANDY
C.J. feed them human interest, not just, “Look, we’re disclosing assets.” People 
will really get a kick out of reading about how much money you guys have, especially 
when they find out you don’t have any.

TOBY
It’s a pretty humiliating way of taking one for the team, isn’t it?

MANDY
They’re going to love you for being broke, Toby. 

TOBY
I found that. I found that women especially can’t get enough of my 1993 Dodge Dart.

LEO
How do we get the votes?

SAM
Well, setting aside Christopher Wick, and I agree with Josh. Someone’s getting that 
wrong. Katzenmoyer and O’Bannon I buy. I’m going to guess the other two are 
Tillinghouse and LeBrandt. That’s what we’re going to hear tomorrow. Now the two of 
them are going to vote together on this, so we’re really only going to need to get 
to one, and whether it’s Tillinghouse or LeBrandt, and it should be Tillinghouse, 
we’re gonna need help.

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Who?

SAM
You’re not going to like it.

LEO
Who?

SAM
The Vice President.

LEO
No way.

JOSH
Leo...

LEO
No way.

JOSH
Tillinghouse and the Vice...

LEO
I’m not using Hoynes.

MANDY
Actually, Leo, I have to agree...

LEO
[looks at his watch] What time do you have? My watch says two o’clock?

SAM
[looks at his watch] It’s two o’clock.

LEO
Did someone pay for this?

MANDY
I got it.

LEO
Make sure you turn in a receipt. I gotta go home. [as he leaves] Toby, Sam,
beautiful work. 

SAM
Thank you.

TOBY
[points at Sam with chopsticks] Two and a half paragraphs. [points at himself]
Thirty-seven pages.

CUT TO: EXT. LEO’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
Leo’s car pulls up to his house. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks in and puts down a paper on a table. His wife, JENNY walks halfway down 
the stairs in her nightgown.

JENNY
Where’ve you been?

LEO
What do you mean?

JENNY
The event was over at 10:30. I thought you were gonna come straight home.

LEO
I’m really sorry, Jenny.

JENNY
What happened?

LEO
We’re five votes short on 802.

JENNY
[exasperated] And what could you possibly do about that at two o’clock in the 
morning that you can’t do during normal business hours?

LEO
I can do things, Jenny. I wake people up. I meet with key staff. It’s a long...

JENNY
Leo... [pause] Come to bed.

LEO
Yeah, I’ll be right up. [sees a box on the table, picks it up and looks at it] 
What’s this?

JENNY
It’s a wristwatch.

LEO
For me?

JENNY
Yes.

LEO
From you?

JENNY
Yeah.

LEO
For what?

JENNY
[sighs] Our anniversary. 

LEO looks terrible. 

JENNY [cont.]
Come to bed.

FADE TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
TUESDAY MORNING
Toby is sitting in his office talking with a woman named LEELA from the White House 
Counsel’s office.

LEELA
Unusual, don’t you think?

TOBY
I honestly couldn’t say.

LEELA
I’m saying, only owning one stock issue.

TOBY
Yes.

LEELA
It’s pretty unusual.

TOBY
And I’m saying I really couldn’t say. I have no background or education in the 
stock market. I’m a speechwriter.

LEELA
You’re the communications director, Toby. You can’t tell me you have no...

TOBY
I can tell you, Leela. Ask the Treasury Secretary. Ask the Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve. I’m a total novice at this. 

LEELA
Toby...

TOBY
I have never owned a share of stock until last year. 

LEELA
What made you buy the stock?

TOBY
I use the website. I like the company.

LEELA
Five thousand dollars worth?

TOBY
That’s right.

LEELA
And now the stock is worth one hundred and twenty-five thousand?

TOBY
Leela, I’m as surprised as anybody. I didn’t know until the accountant called your 
office.

LEELA
Did you know that seventy-one percent of the increase happened the day after Cal 
Poly professor Theodore McGregor testified to the Commerce Committee on the future 
of Internet stocks?

TOBY
Of course I didn’t. I’m telling you that I’ve never paid any attention...

Someone knocks at the door. 

TOBY 
Yes?

Carol, pokes her head in Toby’s door.

CAROL 
Excuse me, Toby. 

TOBY
Yeah.

CAROL
Sam says they’ve got all five.

TOBY
Tillinghouse?

CAROL
Yeah

TOBY
Thank you. 

Carol leaves while Toby writes something on a pad.

LEELA
White House Counsel’s office is going to want to investigate.

TOBY
Leela, I’ve got forty-eight hours to a crucial floor vote. Is there any way that...?

LEELA
Toby, you’re the one who arranged for McGregor to testify in front of Commerce in 
the first place.

TOBY
I grew up on the same block as Ted McGregor. He’s very well respected-

LEELA
No, I understand. But market analysts widely attribute the jump in technology stocks 
to the testimonies of, among others, your boyhood friend. [incredulously] 
Are you telling me you didn’t know what he was going to say to the committee? 

TOBY
I’m telling you that not only didn’t I know what he was going to say to the 
committee, not only didn’t I care what he was going to say to the committee, but 
if he had sat in my office while I typed up his testimony for him. [yells]
I wouldn’t have understood what he was going to say to the committee!

LEELA
Toby.

TOBY
What!

LEELA
Friend to friend.

TOBY
[calms down] Yeah.

LEELA
You know that manipulating the stock market, or trying to or conspiring to 
manipulate the market in any way...is a federal crime, right?

TOBY
Are you saying I should be talking to a lawyer?

LEELA
Toby, I’m saying you’re talking to one right now. 

TOBY looks worried.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Josh and Sam are leaving the Oval Office. They pass Mrs. Landingham.

JOSH
So what’s the range of what we’re talking about?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Congratulations, Josh.

JOSH
Thanks, Mrs. Landingham.

SAM
What’s she congratulating you on?

JOSH
I don’t know.

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
What’s the range?

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
Votes are expensive. O’Bannon’s going to want the farm subsidies revisited, 
Katzenmoyer’s gonna go back to the federal tax exempt metro link. We’re talking 
about unions, defense contracts, possibly agency appointments and my point is 
that the clock’s running, and we’re no closer to answering the question.

JOSH
Which question?

SAM
How we get five votes without giving away everything in the store.

A woman passes by.

WOMAN
Congratulations, Josh.

JOSH
Thanks.

SAM
What the hell’s going on...?

JOSH
We do it by giving away nothing in the store.

SAM
We can’t...

JOSH
I say nothing.

SAM
What’re you saying?

JOSH
L.B.J. never would’ve taken this kind of crap from Democrats in Congress. He’d have 
said, “You’re voting my way, in exchange for which, it is possible that I might 
remember your name.” [stops walking] Pal, we need to win. And I mean win. We need 
to take a curtain call and a victory lap. And that’s how we get momentum. We get it 
by being tough. We give away nothing. That’s what I’m taking to Leo.

SAM
And Chris Wick?

JOSH
Chris Wick, I own his ass.

They walk into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA to cheering and shouts of “Congratulations”. 
Donna walks up.

JOSH
I sense I’m being mocked.

DONNA
Congratulations, Josh.

JOSH
What did I do?

DONNA
You won our award for best gift valued over twenty-five dollars on the financial 
disclosure report.

JOSH
Really?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
What won it for me?

DONNA
The 1189 dollar Viennatelli silk smoking jacket from Miss Sarah Wissinger.

JOSH
Ah, yes.

DONNA
You’re also the runner up, by the way, with the 345 dollar antique scrimshaw 
cigarette holder, also from Miss Sarah Wissinger.

JOSH
Well, Sarah was very fond of me.

DONNA
I’d imagine with that smoking jacket and the cigarette holder, you were quite the dandy.

JOSH
All right, this was fun, but Sam and I are busy making critical decisions, and I’m 
sure you have a lot of typing to do. So I’ll talk to you later.

DONNA
Bye. [walks off]

Sam and Josh keep going, right past Josh’s office.

JOSH
I’ll take care of Chris Wick.

SAM
Where are you going?

JOSH
[stops and looks at Sam] Where are you going? 

SAM
I was following you.

JOSH
I was following you. [pause] All right, don’t tell anyone this happened, okay?

Josh heads back towards his office as Toby comes around the corner.

TOBY
Sam! I’ve got a problem. I need to talk to you for a few minutes.

SAM
Sure. [heads off with Toby]

Leo and Margaret, come in from the entrance.

LEO
It can be Dom. It can be Kristal. She likes them both.

MARGARET
Which do you like?

LEO
I don’t drink champagne. The important thing is that it be in a high hat.

MARGARET
What’s that?

LEO
It’s the silver bucket that rests on a tripod. In fact, the whole meal should be 
under sterling silver.

MARGARET
They’ll know what that means?

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
How about music?

LEO
I’ll put on a record.

MARGARET
You don’t want a violinist?

LEO
To play the violin?

MARGARET
Yeah.

LEO
Is that what people get now?

MARGARET
I know it’s available.

LEO’S OFFICE. Margaret follows Leo inside.

LEO
No. ‘Cause after the initial thing wears off there’s just a guy with a violin in my 
house.

MARGARET
Right.

LEO
Harry Winston’s sending down the choker.

MARGARET
It’ll be here this afternoon.

LEO
It’s the right size.

MARGARET
We can only hope.

LEO
My wife’s got a great neck.

MARGARET
This will certainly call attention to it.

LEO
Would you stop?

MARGARET
You spend too much money.

LEO
And you can squeeze the life out of a nickel better than any ten people I know.

MARGARET
Well, excuse me for not having made forty thousand a pop on the lecture circuit.

LEO
Stop reading the disclosure reports! They’re none of your business.

MARGARET
They’re going to be printed in the newspapers in two days.

JOSH
[knocks and comes in] Leo?

LEO
Josh, do women like violinists?

JOSH
You thinking about taking lessons?

LEO
No, I mean to listen to next to the table.

JOSH
Gets a little weird after a minute, doesn’t it?

LEO
That’s what I thought.

JOSH
Is it Jenny’s birthday?

LEO
[quietly] I forgot our anniversary.

JOSH
In that case I’d shift into gear and bring on the Julliard String Quartet.

LEO
[to Margaret] Call the guy.

MARGARET
Perhaps Mrs. McGarry would enjoy you in a nice smoking jacket. [looks pointedly at Josh]

JOSH
Leave.	

LEO
Call the guy.

Margaret leaves.

JOSH
I’m going to see Katzenmoyer.

LEO
When?

JOSH
Right now.

LEO
What’re you gonna give him?

JOSH
Nothing more than a wake up call. I want your permission to kick his ass.

LEO
You want to dangle his job in front of him?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
No.

JOSH
I wanna let him hear the branch creak.

LEO
We do that. It doesn’t work. We can’t do it again. 

JOSH
If it doesn’t work, I back off. If it doesn’t work, we give Katzenmoyer a metro link 
and we let O’Bannon order off the menu. If it does work, I think we get the other 
four votes no problem when word gets out we’re not screwing around.

LEO
[gives in] I should sell tickets to this meeting.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

Josh and CONGRESSMAN KATZENMOYER are strolling along in front of the Capitol Building.

KATZENMOYER
You gotta understand the people in my district, Josh.

JOSH
Your constituents like the Tech 9 and the Rutger Mini 14, do they? They go quail 
hunting with an Uzi?

KATZENMOYER
I won with fifty-two percent of the vote. From the moment I’m sworn in I need to 
raise ten thousand dollars a week just to run a reelection campaign.

JOSH
And you’re not doing so well.

KATZENMOYER
Averaging sixty-five hundred. That’s money I can just squeak by with. The NRA makes 
me a target in the next election. I lose, plain and simple. Ask me two years from 
now. I’ll be there for you.

JOSH
Fifty-five thousand more people will be shot and killed with guns two years from now, 
but that’s very much beside the point.

KATZENMOYER
What is your point?

JOSH
Forgive my bluntness, and I say this with all due respect, Congressman, but vote yes, 
or you’re not even going to be on the ballot two years from now.

KATZENMOYER
How do you figure?

JOSH
You’re going to lose in the primary.

KATZENMOYER
There’s no Democrat running against me.

JOSH
Sure there is.

KATZENMOYER
Who?

JOSH
Whomever we pick.

KATZENMOYER
You’re bluffing.

JOSH
[shrugs] Okay. [starts to walk away. Katzenmoyer looks worried.]

KATZENMOYER
I’m in your own party! 

JOSH
Doesn’t seem to be doing us much good now, does it? 

KATZENMOYER
It’s an incumbent Democrat. You’ll go to the press and endorse a challenger?

JOSH
No sir. We’re going to do it in person. See, you won with fifty-two percent, but the 
President took your district with fifty-nine. And I think it’s high time we come back 
and say thanks. Do you have any idea how much noise Air Force One makes when it lands 
in Eau Claire, Wisconsin? We’re going to have a party, Congressman. You should come, 
it’s gonna be great. And when the watermelon’s done, right in town square, right in 
the band gazebo... You guys got a band gazebo?

KATZENMOYER
Josh...

JOSH
Doesn’t matter, we’ll build one. Right in the band gazebo, that’s where the President 
is going to drape his arm around the shoulder of some assistant DA we like. And you 
should have your camera with you. You should get a picture of that. ‘Cause that’s 
gonna be the moment you’re finished in Democratic politics. President Bartlet’s a 
good man. He’s got a good heart. He doesn’t hold a grudge. [puts on sunglasses]
That’s what he pays me for. [walks away]

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY

Sam and Toby are in the office talking. Toby is sitting on the couch. Sam is 
standing in front of him.

SAM
125,000 dollars?

TOBY
Could you stop saying that!?

SAM
Sure.

TOBY
How much trouble am I in?

SAM
Well, there’s two kinds of trouble here: actual trouble and PR trouble.

TOBY
Talk about actual trouble.

SAM
You’re in no actual trouble.

TOBY
Really?

SAM
Absolutely not.

TOBY
Good.

SAM
But I’d hire a lawyer anyway.

TOBY
Why?

SAM
Because technically you’ve committed a felony punishable by imprisonment and fines 
reaching into the millions.

TOBY
[gets up to pace] All right, let’s move away from actual trouble for a second and 
let’s talk about...

SAM
Perception.

TOBY
Yes.

SAM
We’ve done nothing wrong, yet the perception of those who would choose to glance 
only at a snapshot would be embarrassing. 

TOBY
Say nothing of damaging to the President.

SAM
[brightly] Indeed.

TOBY
Why are you talking like this?

SAM
Because I can’t help but be reminded of a bright and energetic young White House 
deputy who took no end of admonition and grief because of a woman he was friends with.

TOBY
I totally backed you up on that!

SAM
Which is why I couldn’t be happier to help you. It’s like being able to do something 
for my older brother. I’m your guy on this. What’s your level of confidence?

TOBY
[glumly] Absolutely none.

SAM
Who else knows about this?

TOBY
Anyone who saw the report.

SAM
Everybody has the report, but you really have to study it to have...

C.J.
[comes to the open door] Excuse me, Toby. I was heading out for lunch and I’m a 
little short. You wouldn’t happen to have 125,000 dollars I could borrow, would you? 
[dissolves into laughter as she walks away]

SAM
I got your back on this, buddy.

TOBY
I am so... completely screwed.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - MORNING
C.J. is standing at the podium addressing a small number of reporters.

C.J.
145 dollar Armani cravat, which I’m pretty sure is a necktie. It was a gift from 
his brother-in-law. He gave it away to the Salvation Army. Information I’m sure the 
President would prefer his brother-in-law did not have. 

Laughter.

REPORTER
C.J., I’m curious about the President’s farm in Manchester. The property value 
increased seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. What’s that due to?

C.J.
Secret Service improvements.

REPORTER
Can you do into detail please?

C.J.
The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the 
sun porch. 

Laughter. Josh comes in and stands to the side, waiting for C.J. to finish.

C.J.
That’s all for now, folks. Later this afternoon we’ll do Deputy Chief of Staff 
Joshua Lyman. [joins Josh and head out]

JOSH
Thanks for the promo.

C.J.
They really can’t get enough of you.

HALLWAY. They walk out.

JOSH
I got Katzenmoyer.

C.J.
He’s back?

JOSH
Along with O’Bannon and LeBrandt.

C.J.
You got three!

JOSH
Chris Wick’s waiting for me right now. I don’t know what his story is, but I’m not 
that worried.

C.J.
You worried about Tillinghouse?

JOSH
I can’t get him without the Vice President. Leo’s got to lighten up on that.

C.J. and JOSH walk inside the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE where Donna finds Josh.

C.J.
Get Wick first. And then we’ll deal with it. [walks off]

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Congressman Wick is waiting in the Mural Room.

JOSH
I know.

DONNA
He’s been waiting twenty minutes.

JOSH
I know.

DONNA
You have a legislative liaison meeting in fifteen minutes.

JOSH
I know.

DONNA
And then the East Asia briefing.

JOSH
I know.

DONNA
All right. Well, then this entire conversation served only as a reminder.

JOSH
Actually, it only served as a colossal waste of time and energy. Keep up the good work.

Josh goes inside THE MURAL ROOM. CONGRESSMAN CHRIS WICK, a very young looking man, 
and his staff are waiting.

JOSH
Congressman.

WICK
Dude! 

The young Congressman shakes Josh’s hand, and then starts to introduce him to staff. 

WICK
Uh, John...

JOSH
Right. [to staff] Guys, could you wait outside for a minute, please. The Congressman 
and I want to talk about old times.

WICK
Go ahead. 

JOSH
[watches as the staff leaves] Thanks. Thanks a lot. Could you close the door please? 
[to Wick] Is that supposed to impress me, you have a staff?

WICK
Josh...

JOSH
I told the House minority whip he was crazy. No way is Chris Wick jumping the fence. 
Do you have any idea how stupid this makes me look?

WICK
Uh, look. About that, dude.

JOSH
Shove it, dude. We’re not in a frat house anymore. 

WICK
What the hell, man?

JOSH
Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill and why you feel they should be 
legal.

WICK
Look, I realize I should have called...

JOSH
Let’s start here. Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill.

WICK
If you’d let me explain...

JOSH
You don’t have a clue.

WICK
No. That’s not true.

JOSH
Mac 90.

WICK
Listen...

JOSH
The PCR. NFR. Anything ring a bell?

WICK
My aides were supposed to...

JOSH
They’re both copycats of the AR 15 assault rifle that was banned two years ago. 
It’s the exact same gun.

WICK
Calm down...

JOSH
It’s back. They just changed the grip. How ‘bout the Pat Maxi?

WICK
Semi-automatic, muzzle barrel...

JOSH
[yells] It’s a grenade launcher!

WICK
Yes, I’m trying to...

JOSH
You know, I realize as an adult not everyone shares my view of the world. And with 
an issue as hot as gun control I’m prepared to accept a lot of different points of 
view as being perfectly valid. But we can all get together on the grenade launcher, 
right?

WICK
Josh...

JOSH
I put you in your seat. I got you elected to the House of Representatives.

WICK
Yeah, and now you guys think I’m on the leash. Look, I get taken for granted, Josh. 
I’ve one photo op with the President. One. Me and sixteen other freshmen. That makes 
me weak.

JOSH
You’re not serious.

WICK
I’ve been here over a year. Huh. Where’s the courtship? This isn’t ego. 
A relationship with the White House is currency around here and I need some.

JOSH
You’re voting down a measure that would restrict the sale of deadly weapons because 
nobody invited you to the cool kid’s table?

WICK
Got your attention.

JOSH
You know, I’m so sick of Congress I could vomit. [starts to leave but turns back] 
What do you want?

WICK
A round of golf.

JOSH
President doesn’t play golf.

WICK
What does he play?

JOSH
Chess.

WICK
Over brandy. With the White House photographers and we’re fine.

JOSH
He’s going to kick your ass, you know.

WICK
Whatever. You know, I really don’t appreciate you calling...

JOSH
Chris, you’re a Congressman. You’ve gotta make that real. This time it was me in 
the Mural Room. Trust me when I tell you, you do not wanna have this conversation 
with the guy who works next door. [leaves and sees the staff waiting outside]
You guys take care. [walks away]

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo, C.J. and Mandy are admiring the gorgeous pearl choker Leo bought for his wife. 
Toby is seated, and Sam walks in the door.

MANDY
Wow!

LEO
Wow is right.

C.J.
It is so beautiful.

SAM
Excellent choice, my friend.

LEO
Stop looking at me like that. You’re talking about Jenny.

SAM
[backpedaling] My point being only that it should flatter her neck in ways that 
should please you.

C.J.
Can I try it on?

LEO
No.

MANDY
Can I rub it against my teeth?

LEO
No.

TOBY
Could we possibly talk about me?

C.J.
Are you saying I’m going to stretch it?

JOSH
[comes in] Leo, I got four out of five. I’m absolutely convinced we need the Vice 
President to get Tillinghouse.

C.J.
We’re all agreed on that.

LEO
No.

JOSH
This needs a Texan.

LEO
I have a different idea.

JOSH
What?

LEO
I go to Richardson.

MANDY
You’ve already been through this with Richardson. 

JOSH
The entire caucus. Let’s not get ‘em any more pissed off at us than they are already.

LEO
I’ll talk to Richardson alone.

JOSH
You have to do it quietly and right now.

LEO
[calls] Margaret!

JOSH
Call me as soon as you’ve got it. [leaves]

MARGARET
[enters] Yes sir?

LEO
I need to see Mark Richardson out of the office. 

Margaret leaves.

SAM
You know, Toby. You could afford to buy one of those now if you want.

TOBY
There’s literally no one in the world that I don’t hate right now. 

Everyone laughs except for Toby.

CUT TO: EXT. THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY
CONGRESSMAN RICHARDSON, an imposing African American, is walking with Leo near the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

RICHARDSON
Let me guess. Josh got Katzenmoyer and the rest of them back in the boat. You came 
to me instead of Tillinghouse because you don’t wanna use Hoynes.

LEO
We need this one, Mark.

RICHARDSON
I’m voting no, Leo.

LEO
Mark, it’s all we could get right now and you know it. 

RICHARDSON
You didn’t work hard enough.

LEO
We did.

RICHARDSON
What happened to the Tech DC 9 and the Tech 22? What happened to the Striker 12 and 
the Street Sweeper?

LEO
We had to lose ‘em.

RICHARDSON
You never fought for ‘em.

LEO
We have to do this inch by inch. You know how this works.

RICHARDSON
No, I know how you guys work.

LEO
That is out of line, Congressman. Guns are number one on my list of priorities and 
I’ve never moved the President off of that.

RICHARDSON
Keeping the White House strong is number one on your list of priorities.

LEO
If the White House isn’t strong, it doesn’t really matter what number two on my 
list is. God, Mark. The bodies being wheeled into the emergency room are black. 
These guns aren’t going to Scottsdale, Mark, they’re going to Detroit, they’re 
going to Philadelphia. An entire generation of African American men are being eaten 
alive by drugs and poverty.

RICHARDSON
Well, I’m encouraged to hear the White House has discovered there’s a drug problem 
in this country. I mean your penetrating insight is matched only by the courage 
displayed in the authorship of this bill.

LEO
Mark, for God sake...

RICHARDSON
Not the three-inch grip, but the two-inch grip. With the forty-gauge barrel and the 
thirty round clip, not the twenty round clip. With a three-day wait to run a check 
to see if you’re crazy. As if wanting the gun wasn’t a pretty good heads up in the 
first place. No, this is for show. And I think it’s an unconscionable waste of the 
taxpayer’s money to have it printed, signed and photocopied, to say nothing of 
enforced. No, I want the guns, Leo. You write a law that can save some lives. I’ll 
sign it. In the mean time, please don’t tell me how to be a leader of black men. 
You look like an idiot. [walks away leaving Leo looking stunned]

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Mandy is reading the financial disclosures. Josh is standing behind his desk.

MANDY
Someone gave you a year’s supply of fruit?

JOSH
Yes.

MANDY
Why?

JOSH
There are people who like me.

MANDY
Why?

DONNA
[pokes her head in] It’s Leo.

JOSH
[picks up the phone] What happened? [listens, then groans]

MANDY
That’s it. He needs to talk to Hoynes. We’ll set up a meeting.

JOSH
Yeah Leo. We’re going to set up a meeting for you with the Vice President. [listens] 
Good.

CUT TO: EXT. LEO’S HOUSE - NIGHT
TUESDAY NIGHT
Leo’s car pulls up to his house to find a taxi waiting. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Leo comes in and finds Jenny’s bags sitting by the door. He walks over to the dining 
room and sees the dinner he ordered untouched on the table.

LEO
Jenny?

JENNY
[walks into the room wearing the choker] I’m still here.

LEO
What’s going on?

JENNY
Leo...

LEO
What’s going on?

JENNY
Honey, I’m so sorry you went to all this trouble.
 
LEO
It wasn’t any trouble.

JENNY
[sighs] I can’t do this anymore. This is crazy. I don’t want to live like this. 
I just can’t.

LEO
I’m sorry about the anniversary. I just...

JENNY
It’s not the anniversary. It’s everything. It’s the whole thing.

LEO
This is the most important thing I’ll ever do, Jenny. I have to do it well.

JENNY
It’s not more important than your marriage.

LEO
[emphatically] It is more important than my marriage right now. These few years, 
while I’m doing this, yes, it’s more important than my marriage. I... I didn’t 
decide to do this myself, Jenny. There were many discussions...

JENNY
I think if you can find the time to...

LEO
I’m five votes down, Jenny! And I need to win. I met with the staff...

JENNY
You made the time.

LEO
I made the time tonight.

JENNY
You didn’t make the time tonight.

LEO
I hired a whole...

JENNY
Margaret phoned to confirm your nine o’clock meeting with the Vice President.

LEO
[beat] I was going to slip out for 45 minutes...

JENNY
Leo...

LEO
I was going to be right back.

JENNY
I can’t. Really.

LEO
I don’t suppose we could postpone this discussion until... It’s just the past 
couple of days...

JENNY
I have to go now.

LEO
Okay.

JENNY
[puts on jacket] I’ll be at the Watergate. 

LEO
Okay.

JENNY
And I’ll talk to you later.

LEO
[with a catch in his throat] You’ll call me? 

JENNY
Yeah. [starts to pick up bags]

LEO
You... you want me to carry that to the cab?

JENNY
It’s okay. [opens door]

LEO
[almost in tears] Call me before you go to sleep.

JENNY
Okay. 

Jenny shuts the door behind her, leaving Leo looking devastated.
FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE VICE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Hoynes is sitting in his office reading a newspaper. His secretary, JANEANE comes 
to the door.

JANEANE
Excuse me sir, Leo McGarry’s here.

HOYNES
Send him in. [gets up and greets Leo as he walks in]

LEO
Good evening, Mr. Vice President.

HOYNES
Come on in. Thanks, Janeane.

LEO
Thanks.

Janeane leaves.

HOYNES
What did you need to see me about?

LEO
Um... I came in to talk to you about 802. We lost five votes.

HOYNES
I know.

LEO
We got four of them back, but I was stupid with Richardson. And now it’s 
Tillinghouse, so I wanted to talk to you about that and...

HOYNES
Leo, are you feeling okay? Sit down. Go on. Sit down. [They both sit.]

LEO
Jenny and I are splitting up and it just happened and I’m feeling a little, um...

HOYNES
[calls] Janeane!

Janeane appears at the door, waiting for instructions. 

LEO
If I could just have a glass of water.

HOYNES
Janeane, could you get me a glass of ice water please. [to Leo] Leo, it’s going to 
be fine. These things happen. 

LEO
Yeah.

HOYNES
I mean, do you... you wanna talk about it at all? 

Leo shakes his head in answer as Janeane returns with the water.

LEO
Thank you. [takes a large drink] Anyway... 

HOYNES
I’ll see Tillinghouse.

LEO
[surprised] Yeah?

HOYNES
I’ll see him tomorrow morning.

LEO
You’ll deliver him?

HOYNES
It’s a done deal.

LEO
I don’t need to tell you we need this win.

HOYNES
I think we’re home.

LEO
Thanks, John. I want you to know the President and I appreciate it. [starts to leave]

HOYNES
Leo. Do you mind if I ask you a question?

LEO
What?

HOYNES
When was the last time you went to a meeting?

LEO
A.A.? 
What meeting could I possibly go to?

HOYNES
Mine.

LEO
John, tell me you are not showing your face-

HOYNES
Leo, I have got my own meeting. Every week. The downstairs office here at the 
O.E.O.B. at 11 p.m. There are nine of us three senators, two cabinet secretaries, 
one federal judge and two agency directors. There’s an agent outside, the whole 
thing looks like a card game.

LEO
Do I have enemies in that room?

HOYNES
All our people.

LEO
I had no idea.

HOYNES
Neither will anyone else. You should think about it.
 
Leo nods and gets up to leave.

HOYNES
Now, are you driving?

LEO
Uh. No, I’ve got my guy.

HOYNES
Good. Good evening. I’m sorry about Jenny.

LEO
Call me after Tillinghouse.

HOYNES
It’s in the bag.

LEO
Good night John.

HOYNES
Good night Leo.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
WEDNESDAY MORNING
Josh leaves his office, where Mandy is waiting in ambush. They head for the Oval Office.

MANDY
Hi there.

JOSH
How you doing?

MANDY
Sarah Wissinger?

JOSH
Yes. A smoking jacket and a cigarette holder. Both declared items. I am clean as a whistle.

MANDY
You received these gifts on July 3rd.

JOSH
I’m sensing trouble, but I can’t quite...

MANDY
You and I didn’t break up until July 9th.

JOSH
Ah, there it was, right in front of my face.

MANDY
She was giving you presents on July 3rd?

JOSH
You knew I knew Sarah.

MANDY
I didn’t know she was giving you presents.

JOSH
They weren’t by way of saying “Thanks for sleeping with me” if that’s what you mean.

MANDY
[walks ahead of him into Oval Office] Don’t talk to me.

Mandy and Josh enter THE OVAL OFFICE, where Toby, Sam, and C.J. are waiting.

JOSH
Hey.

TOBY
What’s going on?

JOSH
Hoynes is having breakfast with Tillinghouse.

MANDY
Sarah Wissin-slut gave him the jacket on July 3rd. 

JOSH
I really thought a nice by-product of not going out with you anymore would be that 
you wouldn’t yell at me anymore.

MANDY
That was a bit unrealistic, wasn’t it?

JOSH
Where’s the President?

TOBY
Haven’t seen him.

Leo comes in from his office. Everyone turns to look at him.

C.J.
Leo, how’d it go?

LEO
What do you mean?

JOSH
Last night.

LEO
[realizes what they’re talking about and puts on a good face] Oh. Oh, great.

C.J.
She liked the choker?

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
And the violinist?

LEO
Uh. You-You’re right. After a couple of minutes it’s strange having him there. 
But, uh, you know um... [faking smile] She ate it up, so...

They all congratulate him. Then a pause.

TOBY
Where’s the President?

LEO
His back is pretty bad today. He canceled the morning. He’ll stay in bed and make 
some calls. We should move this to my...

Leo stops as Bartlet enters from outside. He’s wearing jeans and a Notre Dame 
sweatshirt and is looking slightly drugged.

BARTLET
Hey!

LEO
Mr. President. I thought you were staying in bed. 

BARTLET
Oh, I feel fine.

LEO
Uh... Maybe you should get back to the residence.

BARTLET
Hmm?

LEO
I said, maybe you should get back to the residence. Maybe you should lie down.

BARTLET
Absolutely no need. I’m fine. What’s going on here?

SAM
Nothing you need to concern yourself with, Mr. President. Merely a perception issue 
regarding Toby and the financial disclosure.

BARTLET
I like to... [mimes rolling sleeves] Roll up my sleeves and you know... [pause]
...get involved.

C.J.
Mr. President. Did you by any chance take your back pills?

BARTLET
I don’t mind telling you C.J. I was in a little pain there.

LEO
Which did you take, sir, the Vicadin or the Percocet? 

BARTLET
I wasn’t supposed to take ‘em both?

C.J.
Okay. Mr. President, we’re going to have someone take you back to bed.

BARTLET
No no no. Sit sit sit. 

All sit down. Bartlet sits between Toby and Sam.

BARTLET [cont.]
One of you’s got a problem and I’m here to help. You guys are like family. You’ve 
always been there for me, always been loyal. Honest, hard working, good people, 
and I love you all very much. I don’t say that often enough. So tell me what the 
problem is, Toby. [puts his hand on Sam’s knee]

SAM
[surprised] I’m Sam, sir.

BARTLET
Sam, of course you are.
 
He puts his arm around Sam as they all watch incredulously.

TOBY
Sir. Sir... The situation basically is this. I arranged for a friend to testify 
to Commerce on Internet stocks while simultaneously, but unrelated to that, bought 
a technology issue which, partly due to my friend’s testimony, shot through the roof.

BARTLET
Toby. [pause] Toby. Toby. Toby. [pause] Toby’s a nice name, don’t you think?

TOBY
[to Leo] Could we possibly do this meeting at another time?

Leo starts to get up.

BARTLET
No, no, no, no. Please, Leo. I know my body. I mean, you know, my muscles are not, 
you know, but my mind is sharp. I can focus. I’m focused. You all know that about me. 
Here’s what I think we ought to do... [long pause] Was I just saying something?

LEO
[stands and calls] Mrs. Landingham!

MANDY
Look, I think we need to run through some options. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[comes in] Yes, sir?

LEO
Get Charlie.

MANDY
Let’s start at the bottom.

SAM
What do you mean?

MANDY
There’s always resignation.

BARTLET
Hot damn! Now you’re talking.

TOBY
I think she meant me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Ah.

LEO
Well of course Toby’s not going to resign. I think we’re making more of this than we...

SAM
I got it!

TOBY
I’ve got a lawyer from the White House Counsel’s office-

SAM
I got it!

MANDY
What?

SAM
Counsel’s office releases a statement through C.J. Using the strongest possible 
language we make it very clear that there’s been no wrongdoing of any kind.

TOBY
Yes.

SAM
But to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, Toby has agreed to reduce his salary 
for one year to one dollar, and immediately cash out his stock issue thereby relieving 
the taxpayer of the burden.

Toby looks shocked.

BARTLET
Done.

TOBY
Wait.

LEO
Good, Sam.

SAM
Thank you.

TOBY
No, no, it’s not good. Actually, it stinks.

BARTLET
Toby, you’re a great writer, do you know that?

TOBY
Well, thank you very much sir.

BARTLET
Here, give me a hug.

TOBY
[looks pained] Leo!

BARTLET
Come on. Give us a hug. [hugs Toby] There you go.

CHARLIE
[walks in] Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Charlie!

CHARLIE
Mr. President, I left you alone for two minutes. 

BARTLET
Charlie’s a great name.

CHARLIE
Thank you. Sir, you have to go back to bed.

BARTLET
I’m going. I’m going. [gets up] Before I go, please let me just say this. [sighs] 
I’m seriously thinking about getting a dog.

LEO
Well, feel better Mr. President.

Charlie leads Bartlet out as everyone grins after them.

BARTLET
Maybe an Irish setter, Charlie. What do you think? 

CHARLIE
I think that’s great sir.

SAM
[to Toby] So, how do you feet there, big guy? 

TOBY
[dryly] Like I just got screwed with my pants on.

SAM
Excellent.

CUT TO: INT. THE VICE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY
Hoynes is having breakfast with CONGRESSMAN TILLINGHOUSE, a Texan with a very 
nasal accent.

TILLINGHOUSE
Honest to goodness, John, this isn’t a political maneuver.

HOYNES
I know.

TILLINGHOUSE
I’m voting my conscience.

HOYNES
I know.

TILLINGHOUSE
You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. Two hundred and forty million guns 
out there. How’re you gonna get them back?

HOYNES
You can’t.

TILLINGHOUSE
Of course not. And as long as they’ve got a gun, I want my wife to have a gun, I 
want my daughter to have a gun, and damn it, I want one too.

HOYNES
Makes perfect sense.

TILLINGHOUSE
You might wanna mention to Josh Lyman that Congressmen don’t appreciate being 
bullied like ill-behaved school children.

HOYNES
Yes.

TILLINGHOUSE
Katzenmoyer, O’Bannon, LeBrandt, this new kid, Christopher Wick. These are grown men, 
with pride and dignity. They can’t be manhandled.

HOYNES
They’re pretty pissed, are they?

TILLINGHOUSE
Behind closed doors they’re screaming bloody murder, and are talking about political 
retribution.

HOYNES
I don’t blame ‘em.

TILLINGHOUSE
Reality is reality.

HOYNES
Yes. Which is why I’d like very much for you to do the following, Cal. I want you to 
vote yes on the resolution.

TILLINGHOUSE
[surprised] John?

HOYNES
And you might want to mention this conversation to Representatives Katzenmoyer, 
O’Bannon, LeBrandt, and Wick.

TILLINGHOUSE
[smiles] Why, John, you do seize the moment, don’t you?

HOYNES
You’ve got a roll call.

TILLINGHOUSE
Tell me something. What’s in it for me?

HOYNES
Right now?

TILLINGHOUSE
Yeah.

HOYNES
Nothing.

TILLINGHOUSE
Then why am I handing you a personal political victory?

HOYNES
Because I’m going to be President of the United States one day, and you’re not.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT
We see the night view of Washington, D.C., while various news reports are heard.

REPORTER 1 [V0]
The restrictions, while not considered sweeping, do include the Mini 9 and the 
Rutger 14. Again, White House senior aides had hoped that this would serve as a 
much-needed victory for the President, but it’s the Vice President who seems to be 
receiving most of the credit from some Congressional Democrats...

REPORTER 2 [V0]
...were quick to praise Vice President John Hoynes for stepping in and securing the 
one vote victory...

REPORTER 3 [V0]
Mark Richardson, leader of the Congressional black caucus, a man, I should add, 
who’s seldom at a loss for words, had no comment tonight. None. You have to ask 
yourself, is this an intentional snub to his old friend Jed Bartlet?

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT

Leo, Toby, Josh, C.J., Sam, Mandy and Donna are watching the telecasts.

MANDY
Unbelievable.

SAM
I don’t believe it.

MANDY
You loosen the ketchup bottle and he pops the top off.

SAM
And keeps the ketchup.

C.J.
Sorry, Leo. You saw this one coming through the Holland Tunnel.

LEO
We got what we deserved. It was hubris and we got what we deserved. 
[gets up to leave] Night everyone.

Everyone says good night. Leo walks away, but turns back to Josh, who’s not 
looking happy.

LEO
Listen. We won. [leaves]

TOBY
Where’s the President?

C.J.
He’s asleep.

TOBY
Wake him up.

Josh leaves.

C.J.
Toby.

TOBY
Wake him now.

C.J.
Let’s leave it till tomorrow, Toby. Let’s leave it till tomorrow. 

C.J. fiddles with a Magic Eight Ball.

CUT TO: INT. THE VICE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Hoynes is sitting at his desk. Janeane comes to the door.

JANEANE
Sir. Uh, Josh Lyman is here. He was wondering if he could see you a moment.

HOYNES
Sure.

JOSH
[walks in] Evening Mr. Vice President.

HOYNES
Josh. Nice victory.

JOSH
Are you talking about the bill or are you talking about my smoking jacket?

HOYNES
[laughs] I heard about that. No, I was talking about the bill.

JOSH
It’s a crappy law.

HOYNES
Nah.

JOSH
No, it is. I should know. I helped write it.

HOYNES
You did very well.

JOSH
I’d say it’s roughly the equivalent of fighting the war against tobacco by banning 
certain color matchbook covers.

HOYNES
[laughs] Well, these things happen slowly.

JOSH
I’d say you did well, sir. In fact, you might be the only one who did. I just came 
by to say congratulations.

JANEANE
[comes to the door] Mr. Vice President.

HOYNES
Right, Janeane. I’m on my way. [gets up and puts on coat] Josh.

JOSH
Yes sir?

HOYNES
[walks to Josh and pats him on the shoulder] Welcome to the NFL.

Josh watches him leave.

CUT TO: INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING  - NIGHT
Leo walks down a flight of stairs into a basement hallway of the O.E.O.B. There is 
a Secret Service Agent standing by the door.

AGENT
Something I could help you with, Mr. McGarry?

LEO
[looks apprehensive] Yeah. I’m here for the card game.

The agent nods and opens the door.

LEO
Thank you.

Leo walks into the room, looks around nervously, and closes the door behind him.
FADE OUT.

Episode 1.4 -- “Five Votes Down”
Original Airdate: October 13, 1999, 9:00 EST

Transcript By: Cindy Dechief


West Wing S01E05
Josh (Bradley Whitford) is troubled when he receives a special card informing him of where to safely go in the event of a nuclear attack -- a privilege denied to most of his White House co-workers -- while Leo (John Spencer) instructs the senior staff to meet with various special interest groups, some of whom have wacky agendas. Prior to an important press conference, Toby (Richard Schiff) voices strong opposition to many of President Bartlet's (Martin Sheen) plans for an upcoming California trip and later checks out the rumor that he was not the chief executive's first choice for the job. The President, meanwhile, virtually orders his staff to sample his prized chili when he arranges a reception for his Georgetown-bound daughter, Zoey (Elisabeth Moss).

TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT
In a basketball court outside the White House, we see Bartlet, playing a game of 
basketball with a few of the White House staffers, including Toby, Josh and Charlie. 
Surrounding the court are Secret Service Agents. We hear the basketball bouncing.

BARTLET [OS]
Oh, man. I’m sorry.

Toby takes the President to low post, shoots over him, and makes the shot off the 
backboard.

JOSH
Oh yes!

CHARLIE
That’s how you do it now.

TOBY
Game point.

CHARLIE
Mr. President you look a little winded.

The President, with hands on his knees, tries to catch his breath.

BARTLET
I’m fine.

CHARLIE
Maybe you want to sit out for a minute, sir.

BARTLET
Why would I want to do that?

JOSH
Cause people are bound to be pretty upset when they find out we killed the President.

TOBY
Sit down, sir.

BARTLET
All right, game point. Let’s go.

JOSH
Sir...

BARTLET
I’m playing.

TOBY
Mr. President, there’s no shame in calling it quits. All you have to do is say, 
“Toby, you’re the superior athlete,” and slink on off the court.

BARTLET
Take the ball out, Toby.

TOBY
You’re really going to keep playing?

BARTLET
Take the ball out. Let’s go.

TOBY
Oh, this is perfect, you know that? This is a perfect metaphor. After you’re gone, 
and the poets write, “The Legend of Josiah Bartlet,” let them write you as a tragic 
figure, sir. Let the poets write that he had the tools of greatness, but the voices 
of his better angels was shouted down by his obsessive need to win.

BARTLET
You want to play or write my eulogy?

TOBY
Can I be honest with you, sir?

BARTLET
Mr. Grant!

Bartlet waves to a car in the sidelines. Toby, Josh, and Charlie looks as a Secret 
Service Agent opens a side door of the car and out comes a very tall black guy, 
possibly a professional basketball player. He approaches Bartlet and shakes his hand.

JOSH
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Who’s this guy?

BARTLET
I’m making a substitution.

TOBY
Who is this guy?

BARTLET
Mr. Grant’s a new member of my team.

TOBY
A ringer, perhaps?

BARTLET
Mr. Grant is a federal employee.

TOBY
You know the thing about you, Mr. President? It isn’t so much that you cheat. It’s 
how brazenly bad you are at it.

BARTLET
I beg your pardon?

JOSH
Toby’s got a point there sir.

BARTLET
When have I ever cheated?

TOBY
Up on Florida, playing mixed doubles with me and C.J. You tried to tell us that your 
partner worked at the American Consulate in Vienna.

BARTLET
And she did!

TOBY
It was Steffi Graf, sir.

BARTLET
Well, I will admit that the woman bore a striking resemblance...

TOBY
It was Steffi Graf, you crazy lunatic! You think I’m not gonna recognize Steffi Graf 
when she’s serving a tennis ball at me?

JOSH
Steffi Graf’s won quite a few championships, sir. We’ve had many opportunities to 
see photographs.

BARTLET
Be that as it may, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young. I would like to 
introduce Mr. Rodney Grant. Mr. Grant is Associate Director of the President’s 
Council on Physical Fitness. Game point. Your ball. Let’s go!

TOBY
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 

BARTLET
What? 

TOBY
Not so fast.

BARTLET
What’s the problem?

TOBY
Mr. Grant, your name sounds awfully familiar... Before you joined up with the 
President’s Council on Physical Fitness, a council, I might add, the President would 
do well to avail himself of... Is it possible, that you played some organized ball?

GRANT
Yeah, I used to play a little with my friends.

TOBY
And where was that?

GRANT
I’m sorry?

TOBY
Where would that be?

GRANT
Duke.

Toby and Josh laugh out loud, while Charlie looks at Grant.

TOBY
This guy was in the Final Four!

BARTLET
Take the ball out, Toby. Game point. Let’s go.

TOBY
Alright.

BARTLET
The new man.

TOBY
[to Grant] I’m taking you to the hole.

Toby dribbles the ball into low post. Grant guards him. Bartlet is guarding Josh on 
the other end of the court. Toby tries to shoot the ball. 

JOSH
You got it!

Mr. Grant, with quick reflexes, blocks the ball hard, making it go out of bounds. 
Toby almost falls down.

TOBY
Oh!

BARTLET
Let the poets write about that there, Byron.

TOBY
Charlie, guard the new guy.

Charlie walks in front of Grant and stares at him.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Donna comes out of the bullpen while Josh is walking by. Josh, surprised, continues 
walking down the hallway as the ever loyal Donna walks with him.

DONNA
You have a staff meeting.

JOSH
That’s... where I’m going.

DONNA
I’m just telling you.

JOSH
Yes, but you see that’s obviously where I’m going, and yet you tell me anyway.

DONNA
And you don’t find that adorable?

JOSH
That you seek to control me?

DONNA
Yeah?

JOSH
Love it.

DONNA
Donald hasn’t called me yet.

JOSH
Who’s Donald?

DONNA
Donald?

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
From the thing?

JOSH 
Right. [stops by a side table to get coffee] Can we clear up a few things about my 
level of interest in the revolving door of local gomers that you see, in the free 
time you create by not working very hard at your job?

DONNA
Excuse me?

JOSH
You work hard at your job.

DONNA
How hard?

JOSH
Very hard.

DONNA
And I am?

JOSH
Not at all controlling.

DONNA
Thank you. You have a staff meeting.

JOSH
On my way.

Josh walks on towards the door, and stops and turns back as he hears Donna’s voice again.

DONNA
Wait, uh, there’s another thing.

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Hang on.

JOSH
Donna?

DONNA
Hang on. [takes out a note from a folder] Here it is. Leo wants you to meet someone 
named Lacey from the National Security Council in his office after staff.

JOSH
Thank you. [takes the note, continues on his way, and walks out the door]

DONNA
What do you think it’s about?

JOSH
I don’t know. But this is the White House, so it’s probably not that important.

C.J. quickly walks past Donna and catches up with Josh.

C.J.
Josh!

JOSH
Ma’am.

C.J.
There’s an article I want you to read in the New Yorker.

JOSH
What’s it about?

C.J.
Smallpox.

JOSH
The disease?

C.J.
No, the dessert topping, Josh.

JOSH
Okay.

C.J.
Yes, the disease.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see some of White House staffers seated around the table, including Toby, Mandy, 
Sam, Cathy and Margaret.

MARGARET
We do it at the first of every month.

CATHY
We’ve missed a few months.

SAM
But, generally speaking, we try to do it on the first of every month.

TOBY
We’ve done it twice in 12 months.

SAM
We’re a little behind.

MANDY
I still don’t know what we’re talking about.

TOBY
It’s “Throw Open Our Office Doors To People Who Want To Discuss Things That We 
Could Care Less About... Day”

MANDY
Well, that sounds goofy, doesn’t it?

SAM
It’s not so bad. You talk to them for a minute. You give them a souvenir pen with 
the Presidential seal on it.

MANDY
This isn’t a waste of time?

MARGARET
Oh, it’s definitely a waste of time, but it’s one of Leo’s pet office policies.

MANDY
Why?

LEO
[walks in] Good morning.

TOBY
[whispers to Mandy] Sadly you’re about to find out.

LEO
Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer of his White House had a big block of cheese.

TOBY
Hmmm.

Some of the White House Staffers giggle lightly.

LEO
I am making a mental list of those who are snickering, and even as I speak I’m 
preparing appropriate retribution. [beat] The block of cheese was huge--over two 
tons. And it was there for any and all who might be hungry.

TOBY
Leo, wouldn’t this time be better spent plotting a war against a country that can’t 
possibly defend itself against us?

LEO
We can do that later, Toby. Right now I’m talking about President Andrew Jackson.

SAM
Actually, right now, you’re talking about a big block of cheese.

LEO
And Sam goes on my list!

SAM
What about Toby?

LEO
I’m unpredictable. [beat] Jackson wanted the White House to belong to the people, 
so from time to time, he opened his doors to those who wished an audience.

MANDY
And then he locked the doors behind them and made them eat two tons of cheese.

LEO
It is in that spirit...

SAM
Hang on. Mandy doesn’t go on the list?

LEO
Mandy’s new.

SAM
So it’s just me... on the list?

LEO
Yes. It is in the spirit of Andrew Jackson that I, from time to time, ask senior 
staff to have face-to-face meetings with those people representing organizations 
who have a difficult time getting our attention. [beat] I know the more jaded among 
you, see this as something rather beneath you. But I assure you that listening to the 
voices of passionate Americans is beneath no one, and surely not the peoples’ servants.

JOSH
[walks in with C.J.] Sorry, we’re late. Is it “Total Crackpot Day” again?

LEO
Yes, it is.

SAM
And let us please note that Josh does not go on the list.

LEO
[to Josh] Actually you’ve got a thing right now.

JOSH
Yeah, I know. Donna told me.

LEO
Margaret, hand out those appointments would you?

Josh walks out with Leo from the Roosevelt Room into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
What’s up?

LEO
First of all... [smacks Josh in the head]

JOSH
Ow!

LEO
That’s for “Total Crackpot Day.”

JOSH
Yeah, yeah.

They enter LEO’S OFFICE. Standing in the middle of the room is JONATHAN LACEY. Josh 
offers his hand.

LEO
Second of all, this is Jonathan Lacey.

JOSH
Josh Lyman.

LACEY
Good to meet you. [points at the door] Mr. McGarry, would you mind?

Leo closes the door and stands behind Josh.

LACEY 
[to Leo] Thanks. [to Josh] I only have a few moments. I know you’re busy too.

JOSH
What can I do for you?

Lacey opens a folder on the table. In the folder, attached with a paper clip and a 
cardholder, is a green-colored card. He takes it and gives it to Josh. 

LACEY 
I’d like you to keep this card on your person at all times. If you keep it in your 
wallet and you lose your wallet, your first call isn’t to American Express. It’s to us.

JOSH
[looking at the card] Who’s us?

LACEY
I’m sorry. I thought you knew. I’m with the N.S.C.

JOSH
[still looking the card] They told me that a minute... What’s the card do?

LACEY
Tells you where to go in the event of a nuclear attack.

JOSH
[swiftly looks up] You’re kidding me.

LACEY
Obviously, we want to get everyone up on Air Force One or into one of the underground 
command centers as quickly as possible.

JOSH
[very distraught] Sure...well,um...Okay, I really, um, I don’t know what to say.

LEO
[to Lacey] I guess that’s it then?

LACEY
Should you have any questions, you should feel free to call.

JOSH
Sure. Sure...and my staff goes with me or do they have separate...?

A long silence fills the room. Lacey looks at Leo, who looks away.

JOSH
[surprised] Oh, God! Sorry...you know what? I just got it. Sorry...Ok, sure. 
[takes out wallet] I’m just gonna stick this right here next to my, uh, my video 
club membership and there’s no reason, I guess, why my staff ever has to know 
anything about it...So there it is. [puts wallet back in pocket]
And I think the best thing to do is just forget all about it. I’ll go now.

Leo opens the door. Josh takes a last look at Lacey, walks out and sees White House 
staffers passing through the hallways. He looks left, looks right, looks left, 
looks right again, and walks away.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
The senior staff are preparing the President for a press conference. Sam, Mandy, and 
Leo are sitting in the blue chairs in the room, while Toby is walking around in the 
aisle. Mrs. Landingham carefully watches Bartlet as he walks left and right behind 
the briefing room’s podium as he looks at a bunch of papers through his glasses.

SAM
Last week’s rise in the producer’s price index coupled with the increasingly tight 
labor market have sparked a growing concern over future inflation. Do you share that 
concern, sir?

BARTLET
No, Helen, I don’t. The U.S. economy is fundamentally...

SAM
Ah! I wasn’t Helen there, sir. Actually, I was Sandy King.

BARTLET
From the... Miami Herald?

SAM
She moved to The Sun-Times.

BARTLET
But, your voice sounded the same as when you did Helen.

SAM
[different accent] Do you share that concern, sir?

BARTLET
No, not at all. The U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong as the steady decline 
in unemployment reflects, which I think is cause for satisfaction, not gloom. The 
solitary aberrant spike in the P.P.I. is not cause for overreaction.

SAM
You might also want to point out that there’s been no corresponding increase in 
wholesale prices.

MANDY
Yeah, so Mr. President, if you could further see clear to not answer that question 
like an economics professor with a big old stick up his butt, that would be good too.

BARTLET
I AM an economics professor with a big old stick up my butt, but I’ll do my best for 
you there, Mandy.

MANDY
Thank you, sir.

SAM
[to Toby] That’s it for the economy.

TOBY
Let’s move to guns.

BARTLET
We don’t need to do guns.

TOBY
Sir, they are absolutely gonna ask about guns.

BARTLET
I’m not saying they’re not gonna ask about them, Toby. I’m saying I’m all set.

TOBY
How ‘bout one or two questions, Mr. President?

BARTLET
[looks at watch] Is it time for my 10 a.m. scolding?

LEO
Are we gonna have this argument, again?

TOBY
[with hand raised a little] Mr. President...

BARTLET
Let’s do guns.

TOBY
Sir...

BARTLET
Let’s do guns, Sam.

Toby drops his hand, looks at the President and continues to pace the aisle.

SAM
Mr. President, is there any reason to believe this victory, this weapons ban bill, 
will have any significant reduction in crime?

BARTLET
Yes, next question.

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Ah! Mr. Ziegler from the Coney Island Killjoy. You have a follow up?

Bartlet picks up the cup beside the microphone in the podium, finding it empty, 
puts it back. Mrs. Landingham gets up from her chair and walks to the podium.

TOBY
You’re gonna take the question. We’re lucky enough to get the question, you’re 
gonna take it and blow it off?

BARTLET
Yes.

TOBY
Due respect, sir, may I ask why?

Mrs. Landingham takes the cup from the podium and starts to walk out through the 
back exit.

BARTLET
‘Cause I’m weak-willed and stupid.

LEO
Let’s do this another time.

TOBY
Four days ago sir, we talked this over.

BARTLET
Then I talked it over with some other people.

TOBY
Which people?

BARTLET
I have lots of other people.

TOBY
Sir, I believe we are missing a huge opportunity here...

Toby and the President continue to fight in the background. Just outside the BRIEFING 
ROOM, we see Josh standing by the door staring through space. C.J. walks past him. 
She notices him and looks back.

C.J.
What’s going on?

JOSH
Hmm?

C.J.
What’s going on?

JOSH
Oh, we’re doing the thing.

C.J.
Why aren’t you in there?

JOSH
I was just going in.

Mrs. Landingham, coming from the Briefing Room, walks behind C.J. with the President’s 
cup in her hand.

C.J.
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
They seem to be having a disagreement.

C.J.
A disagreement or a fight?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Well, it certainly has the potential...

BARTLET [OS]
[shouts] Oh, for God’s sakes Toby!

MRS. LANDINGHAM
There we go.

Mrs. Landingham walks out the door. C.J. looks at Josh, who is still staring to space.

C.J.
[to Josh] Let’s go in. [beat] Josh!

JOSH
Hmm?

C.J.
Let’s go in. [walks inside with Josh]

TOBY
Sir...

BARTLET
I’m not gonna come out and say the bill we just passed is worthless.

TOBY
If we could just admit its weaknesses.

MANDY
Toby?

TOBY
Why not?

MANDY
It will infuriate the left, it will energize the right and everyone in the middle 
will feel they just got yanked around...I’m sorry, Mr. President, did you want to 
answer that?

BARTLET
Yeah, my answer was gonna be “because I said so,” but you did pretty good.

MANDY
Say nothing of taking a victory and declaring defeat.

SAM
Yes.

MANDY
Look, Toby, by changing some words...

TOBY
By changing some words, the world can move or not by changing some words.

BARTLET
What’s your point?

TOBY
I have many points, sir. I choose not to make them right now.

BARTLET 
[eating a bagel] Well, on behalf of everybody in the west wing, Toby, let me just 
say that that’s a relief.

Cathy, standing behind Josh and C.J. has just delivered a message for Sam.

SAM
Excuse me, Leo.

LEO
Yes?

SAM
Cathy tells me my first “cheese” appointment is here, but I think preparing the 
President for this press conference should be a priority.

C.J.
I agree.

LEO
No.

C.J.
Leo, it...

LEO
No!

SAM
But I really need to get...

LEO
You’re not getting out of these appointments.

C.J.
This is a very important press conference.

LEO
This is a thoroughly unimportant press conference.

SAM
I think this press conference is about our future.

BARTLET
[still eating] I think this press conference is about we haven’t had a press 
conference in a while.

LEO
Sam, go.

CHARLIE
[walks in] Mr. President? [points at his watch]

BARTLET
We’re going too.

TOBY
Sir...

LEO
[to Toby] We’ll pick this up this afternoon.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam just came in to his office. He sees a nerdy BOB ENGLER sitting in a chair 
beside the door.

SAM
So, you are from the United States Space Command?

BOB
Not a lot of people know about us.

SAM
This is my first time.

BOB
We’re a little nerdy, I’ll admit.

SAM
You camouflage it well with your clothing.

BOB
I’m used to that, Sam.

SAM
What can I do for you, Bob?

BOB
In a nutshell?

SAM
So to speak.

BOB
We’d like the White House to pay a little more attention to UFOs.

SAM
Are we paying any attention at all right now?

BOB
No.

SAM
Thank God. Like we don’t have enough trouble with the First Lady and her Ouija board.

BOB
I would like you to show the President some data we’ve collected on some possible 
extraterrestrial contact.

SAM
I really can’t do that.

BOB
May I ask why not?

SAM
Because the President will either yell at me or laugh at me. Either way, it won’t 
work out well for me.

BOB
This morning at 6:35 a.m. local time, air traffic control in Honolulu picked up an 
unidentified flying object flying east across the Pacific towards California. Air 
Force and Naval Jets have been in the area for hours and have been unable to 
establish visual contact. These things happen and go unexplained. You don’t think 
this is something you should take to the President?

SAM
No.

BOB
Again, may I ask why not?

SAM
Because there are levels and an order to our air defense command, and to jump from 
a radar officer to a commander-in-chief would skip several of those levels.

BOB
Like what?

SAM
Like the Pentagon, and, you know, perhaps, therapy.

BOB
Okay, I can see that.

SAM
Bob, no hard feelings, but I can’t walk into the cabinet room and ask the President 
to put down the budget surplus because there are flying saucers over Maui.

BOB
Something’s heading east in the sky over the Pacific. It’s in and out of our radar. 
We can’t see it, and it’s up there right now. I leave you with that thought.

SAM
It’s been good meeting with you, and I hope that you don’t feel that you’ve wasted 
your time... I leave you with this pen. [shows a pen with a Presidential seal on it]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. walks out of the Press Room. Mandy approaches her. C.J., not looking at Mandy,
carries and places some papers from different places as she walks.

MANDY
I know the President’s not wild about Larry Posner’s fund-raiser on the California 
trip, but I think we can’t pass. And I want to know where you were on this.

C.J.
You don’t have to worry about me on Hollywood fund-raisers. You have to worry about 
Toby.

MANDY
I know. That’s why I’m shoring up support.

C.J.
I’m in.

C.J. walks in the secretaries’ bullpen. The confused Mandy passes through the bullpen, 
sees C.J. through the glass, and walks back to enter the bullpen.

MANDY
They sent pictures of the Malibu place. It’s great.

C.J.
This wasn’t the one we used during the primary?

MANDY
No, he bought another place.

C.J.
Where was the one where Roberto Benigni pushed me into this swimming pool?

MANDY
That was Larry Posner’s house, but that was the old place. C.J....if it gets a vote 
then isn’t it worth it?

C.J.
Which would be fine if Roberto Benigni can vote in our elections, but since he’s 
Italian, that makes me a six foot wet girl in a Donna Karan dress.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are meeting with distinguished people concerned with economics.

LEO
I’m the only one in the room who isn’t an economist, but it seems to me that the 
annual budget for the new fiscal year is found either in balance, in deficit, or 
in surplus. I don’t know how I can sell congress, to say nothing of people who 
graduated eighth grade on the idea that there’s anything in between.

BARTLET
Leo’s not talking about the portion being accounted for as off budget and 
particularly not the long-term capital outlays.

LEO
[points at the President] Here’s where you lose me.

BARTLET
Ten years ago, the federal budget had a deficit of 22 billion dollars but the 
national debt rose... 

Charlie walks in the door behind the President.

BARTLET [cont.]
...from 5.2 trillion to 5.4 trillion in the same fiscal year.

Charlie gives the President the note in his hand.

BARTLET [cont.]
Thank you. That’s a debt increase of 188 million against a 22 billion dollar deficit.
[reads note] Oh, this is good news.

WOMAN
[to the President] You knew those numbers in your head?

LEO
The President’s startlingly freakish that way.

BARTLET
[to Leo] Zoey’s coming for dinner.

LEO
She’s in town!

BARTLET
Yeah. [to everyone in room] My daughter’s starting Georgetown after the first and 
she’s scouting off-campus housing. Guys, we’re done. I’m sorry, but some of my staff 
has been waiting and they haven’t had the chance to bother me for a couple of hours. 
Thanks so much.

Bartlet and Leo come out of the ROOSEVELT ROOM.

BARTLET 
I’m gonna make chili!

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I’ll make it for everybody. Charlie!

LEO
Sir...

BARTLET
My friends, my daughter, my beer, and some chili. Yes!

LEO
And you’re gonna be the one to, you know, cook this food?

They enter THE OVAL OFFICE. Charlie comes from behind them.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
Ah, Charlie. My youngest daughter, Zoey, is down from Hanover. I’m making chili 
tonight. It’s her favorite.

CHARLIE
Uh, sir, you know the first lady does not want you to eat...

BARTLET
The first lady’s in Pakistan. I can eat whatever I want.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I’m gonna need some ingredients.

CHARLIE
Like what?

LEO
Well, he’ll need some chili.

BARTLET
Don’t ever listen to him. Look, Mrs. Landingham’s got it all written down somewhere. 
Just tell her to give it to the steward’s office. And send everyone else in.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. [walks off]

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie!

LEO
How could you possibly remember that ten years ago there was a 188 million dollar 
debt increase off a 22 billion dollar deficit?

BARTLET
[hand in chest] God, I was right?

LEO
Ah, see, that’s what I thought.

Bartlet laughs and LEO smiles. The senior staff walk in.

BARTLET
Everyone! Come in. Come on in. Hey, listen up everybody. Zoey’s down from Hanover. 
I’m making chili for everyone tonight.

SENIOR STAFF
[very weak and uninterested] Great. Okay. Chili.

BARTLET
[looks at Leo then to his staff] All right...You know what? Let’s do this. Everybody 
look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.

They all look down at the Presidential Seal on the carpet in the middle of the room.

BARTLET
Now, everybody look back up at me. Zoey’s coming down from Hanover and I’m making 
chili for everyone tonight.

SENIOR STAFF
[loud and very excited] That’s great! I love chili! Terrific!

BARTLET
There, you see how benevolent I can be, when everyone does what I tell them to do. 
Now sit down. [picks up a newspaper and reads. Everyone else sits down.]

LEO
I would like this meeting to last no more than three minutes. I will allow it to 
last no more than five. Speak, Mandy.

MANDY
We’re going to California in a few weeks.

LEO
Yes.

MANDY
Larry Posner would like to host a fundraiser.

TOBY
Nope.

MANDY
Why?

TOBY
‘Cause 24 hours earlier the President’s gonna give a speech to the entertainment 
industry on violence in film and television.

SAM
A speech I don’t think we should be giving.

TOBY
That’s beside the point.

MANDY
What’s the point?

TOBY
Larry Posner’s movies are incredibly violent.

SAM
So is The Godfather. What you mean to say is Larry Posner’s movies are incredibly bad.

TOBY
No, actually, what I mean to say is Larry Posner’s movies are indicative of a 
Hollywood that is excessibly violent, arrogantly violent, and is promoting violence 
and the disrespect to human life. Either way, I don’t see how we can admonish 
Hollywood on a Tuesday and cash their check on a Wednesday. How can we do that?

BARTLET
[still reading] Cause it’s Hollywood. Who gives a damn?

TOBY
Now, hang on a second, Mr. President, you have me drafting a speech for the 
entertainment industry, where we more than suggest to come right out and say that 
much of their product is corruptive. Now are we doing this because we believe that 
it’s time for them to take moral leadership seriously or are we doing it because 
nobody ever lost an election attacking Hollywood?

BARTLET
Why can’t we do both?

TOBY
[sighs] That’s not hypocritical, sir?

BARTLET
No.

TOBY
Why not?

BARTLET
Because Sam is right. It’s not that Larry Posner’s movies have gratuitous sex and 
gratuitous violence. It’s that they suck. They’re terrible. But people go to see them 
because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get 
people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you.

TOBY
How’s that strategy working for us in the war on drugs, sir?

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
We are going to go out there and implore these people to step up to the plate and not 
be quite so casual with the awesome influence that they have. That’s fantastic. But, 
sir, every time someone makes headlines by blowing thunder at this ridiculous target, 
it only serves as a criminal distraction in the pursuit of actual solutions. Now, let 
me just say one other thing. If I were an actor, a writer, or a director, or a producer 
in Hollywood and someone would start coming at me with a list of things that were 
American and un-American, I’d start to think that this was sounding eerily familiar.

BARTLET
[stares at Toby] Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you, Toby?

TOBY
No sir. Nobody ever looks like Joe McCarthy. That’s how they get in the door in the 
first place.

C.J.
We seem to have wandered off the point a bit.

LEO
Yeah. And time’s up.

Everyone stands up and walks out the door. Toby touches his head in frustration.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Chili, tonight!

JOSH
Yes, sir.

MANDY
Thank you.

Out in the HALLWAY, Sam and Josh walk out of the Oval Office. Sam looks at Josh
and notices something.

SAM
You okay?

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
‘Cause you look a little...you know...

JOSH
No. No.

SAM
Cathy?

CATHY
[walks up with mouth full] You know that doughnut sitting on your desk?

SAM
You ate it.

CATHY
That was predictable, wasn’t it?

They enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Sam whispers something to Cathy.

SAM
Hey, is there any word yet on the...

CATHY
The thing’s still out there.

SAM
[to Josh] Had a guy on my office today. He’d like us to spend a little more time 
working on UFOs.

JOSH walks into SAM’S OFFICE. Sam follows.

JOSH
Are we spending any time working on UFOs?

SAM
That’s what I said.

JOSH
‘Cause coming on the heels of Mrs. Bartlet’s Ouija board...

SAM
I hear you.

JOSH
I’m closing the door. [looks out and closes the door]

SAM
The Central Pacific Command’s been picking this thing up on radar all day.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
Right.

JOSH
Listen, you’re close with Cathy, right?

SAM
I haven’t seen her naked, if that’s what you’re asking.

JOSH
[surprised] No, Sam. Well, that’s not what I’m asking.

SAM
I mean, she’s like my younger sister, but she gets paid, and...

JOSH
Right.

SAM
And she frightens me.

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
But I love her.

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
It’s like you and Donna.

JOSH
Right. [beat] When they gave you a card and they told you... that it was just you 
and not Cathy, how did you... how’d you feel about that?

SAM
When they gave me what card?

JOSH
The N.S.C. guy... the card with the directions.

SAM
The directions to...

JOSH
You, C.J., Toby. I’m saying when the N.S.C. guy gave you your cards.

A long pause. 

SAM
Josh... What card?

JOSH
[very surprised] Nothing... I-I-I was thinking of a different... nothing. Nothing.
[opens the door and walks away]

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
A white screen is set for an overhead projector. A woman sitting at the middle of 
the room controls it. Two men on each side of the screen, starts to talk to C.J., 
who is sitting at the other end of the table.

MAN 1
C.J., we’d like to tell you the story of Pluie.

C.J.
Who’s Pluie?

MAN 1
I’m glad you asked.

From the projector, a wolf is shown in the screen. C.J.’s face changes.

C.J.
That’s Pluie.

MAN 1
Yes.

C.J.
Pluie’s a wolf?

MAN 1
Yeah, she is.

C.J.
And you’re gonna tell me her story? [smiles]

MAN 1
Jerry?

MAN 2
For four years, scientists have tracked Pluie as she made her way from Banff 
National Park in Alberta up and down the Rockies. In that time, she’s made three 
round trips between Canada and Wyoming covering 40,000 square miles.

MAN 1
We thing you’ll admit it was a pretty impressive performance for Pluie especially 
when you consider the impediments of modern life she had to conquer: highways, 
housing, forest denuded of trees.

WOMAN
Not to mention the US-Canadian border.

C.J.
Sure, ‘cause no photo I.D. [laughs]

WOMAN
I’m sorry?

C.J.
That was a joke.

MAN 1
Why does Pluie make the trek? Because wolves have to breed with many packs in order 
to keep from becoming extinct.

C.J.
Really?

MAN 1
If they breed among themselves, they’ll eventually produce offspring that’s 
genetically weaker, thus endangering their long-term survival.

C.J.
That helps explain Buckingham Palace. [laughs]

MAN 2
May we tell you what we propose?

C.J.
Sure.

MAN 
The wolves-only roadway.

C.J.
[surprised] The wolves-only roadway?

MAN 
Eighteen hundred miles from Yellowstone to the Yukon Territory complete with 
highway overpasses and no cattle grazing.

C.J.
[still surprised] An 1800-mile wolves-only roadway?

WOMAN
Pluie, you’ll recall, had to...

C.J.
Hang on. How are you gonna teach wolves to follow road signs?

MAN 2
Our scientists are working on a plan.

C.J.
Yeah, but in the meantime, Pluie’s gonna get drunk and wander off the wolves-only 
road and end up eating my cat.

MAN 1
[scoffs] We don’t think that’ll happen.

C.J.
I don’t think this is gonna happen. [indicating the roadway]

JERRY
Perhaps, if we should...

C.J.
First of all, ranchers don’t want wolves returned to the West.

MAN 
Ranchers are killers.

C.J.
No, they’re not. And anyone who says it should take it back. Ranchers face the 
following conditions: falling stock prices, rising taxes, prolonged drought, and 
a country that’s eating less beef. Ranchers want to blame something, and because 
they’re ranchers, they want to fight something. I’d rather be a wolf than us, so 
unless Pluie registers to vote...

WOMAN
Pluie was shot and killed by a rancher in British Columbia last month.

The two men and the woman bow down their heads.

C.J.
I’m... sorry to hear that.

WOMAN
I’m not sure you are.

C.J.
[throat clearing] Just out of curiosity, how much would it cost?

MAN 
That’s the beauty part. With contributions and corporate sponsorship, the cost of 
the taxpayer is only 900 million dollars.

C.J.
[laughs very hard] No, seriously, how much would it cost?

JERRY
C.J., if we’re gonna do this, why not do it right?

C.J.
We’re not gonna do it.

MAN 
Sure, there are other things we could spend the money on.

C.J.
You think?

WOMAN
I’d like to hear what you think. What’s a better way to spend this money?

C.J.
Nine hundred million dollars?

WOMAN
Another war plane, another S&L Bailout?

C.J.
How about we build the nine best schools in the world?

MAN 
Let’s... Let’s move on to the grizzly bear.

C.J. looks as a grizzly bear appears on the screen.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Mandy knocks at Toby's door. Toby, seated at his couch, looks at her and looks back 
at the papers he’s reading.

MANDY
Hi. [leans at door]

TOBY
Hi.

MANDY
Can I talk to you?

TOBY
What’d you get him, a spot on Hollywood Squares?

MANDY
Posner’s a huge supporter, Toby. I don’t have to tell you that.

TOBY
No, you don’t.

MANDY
I came in here to be nice to you, Toby.

TOBY
Go ahead.

MANDY
I don’t like going up against you.

TOBY
I don’t like going up against you.

MANDY
Okay.

TOBY
That’s you being nice?

MANDY
[steps in] I’m glad David Rosen passed on the Communications job. They couldn’t have 
done better than you.

TOBY
[surprised] Excuse me?

MANDY
I’m saying you make a better Communications Director than David Rosen ever would’ve 
been. That’s me being nice.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
An agitated Toby is walking with C.J.

TOBY
Remember a month ago when I asked you if I was the President’s first choice?

C.J.
We’re back to this?

TOBY
And you called me paranoid?

C.J.
Yes.

TOBY
And a nudnik. You called me a paranoid nudnik.

C.J.
Toby, for the 48th time, you are not the President’s second choice.

TOBY
What about David Rosen?

C.J.
What about David Rosen?

TOBY
Mandy was just in my office, and she said she was happy David Rosen passed on my job.

C.J.
Carol, we’re gonna start in a few minutes.

CAROL
[walks by] Should I bring them in?

C.J.
Give ‘em fair warning.

TOBY
David Rosen.

C.J.
I don’t... Toby, I know nothing about David Rosen, and I don’t know where this is 
coming from.

TOBY
He’s about to have a press conference. Let me talk to him about the gun thing. 
We’ll just leave Hollywood for some other time.

C.J.
Since when do you need help talking to the President?

TOBY
Since all of a sudden I became the kid in the class with his hand raised that nobody 
wants the teacher to call on.

C.J.
That’s silly.

TOBY
No, it is not.

C.J.
Toby...

TOBY
Just help me, please.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
A shot of an office building somewhere in the city.

CUT TO: INT. AN APARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh is standing in the middle of the room. Bright light from outside the window 
surrounds him. We see that he’s talking to his psychiatrist, who we’ll know later 
as STANLEY.

JOSH
So, like I said, I appreciate you squeezing me in like this.

STANLEY
I was able to cancel someone when you called.

JOSH
You shouldn’t have Stan. It’s not a big deal.

STANLEY
What’s not a big deal?

JOSH
Uh, I’m out of practice.

STANLEY
Well, that’s what comes from not coming to see me for ten months.

JOSH
Well, I think the idea will make some people I work for nervous. [sits]

STANLEY
Why are you here now?

JOSH 
Hmm. This is gonna sound silly. [beat] There’s a magazine article... a magazine 
article came out... and it said that several countries, some of them are enemies, 
have stored in freezers the smallpox virus.

STANLEY
Are you afraid you might have smallpox?

JOSH
No...Don’t laugh. [beat] I can’t get “Ave Maria” out of my head.

STANLEY
The Schubert?

JOSH
Yeah, I swear it. I’ve been humming it to myself all morning. It’s the strangest 
thing... Why do you think the “Ave Maria?”

STANLEY
Why do you think the “Ave Maria?”

JOSH
I don’t know... My sister used to play it over and over in her room, but that was, 
I don’t know how many years ago.

STANLEY
Your sister who died?

JOSH
Joanie.

STANLEY
Why did Joanie play the “Ave Maria” in her room?

JOSH
She liked music... a lot. She liked it a lot. She wanted to be an orchestra conductor. 
She used to pretend she was conducting the music. Anyway, there’s that. Plus, I have 
to tell you. I was a little thrown off this morning when they gave me this card. And 
it turns out that I was the only one who got one. I mean, of my friends. It surprised 
me... Joanie and Toby and C.J. and Sam.

STANLEY
Joanie?

JOSH
What?

STANLEY
You named Joanie in there. You said you got some kind of card and Joanie didn’t get one.

JOSH
I meant... No, ‘cause we were just talking about Joanie.

STANLEY
What kind of card?

JOSH
It was uh... there really are some things I’m not allowed to talk about. I assure 
you, I’m not withholding anything I’m supposed to be emotionally available for.

STANLEY
Okay.

JOSH
Thanks.

STANLEY
Can you talk about the card without talking about the card?

JOSH
I got to go. [stands up]

STANLEY
Josh?

JOSH
It’s really not a big deal, Stanley. I’m sorry I had you cancel an appointment.

STANLEY
But I did cancel. Why don’t you take your coat off and sit down.

JOSH
It was an impulse. I wasted your time.

STANLEY
Josh, do you think it’s strange that you’ve never told me how Joanie died?

JOSH
I’ve told you.

STANLEY
No, you haven’t.

JOSH
Sure, I have.

STANLEY
No.

JOSH
It’s not a big deal. [thinks it over, sits down] Uh, she was babysitting for me, 
and there was a fire.

STANLEY
How’d the fire start?

JOSH
I honestly... I don’t remember... Something about a popcorn maker.

STANLEY
The house caught on fire?

JOSH
Yeah.

STANLEY
While your sister Joanie was babysitting for you?

JOSH
Yeah.

STANLEY
Why aren’t you dead?

JOSH
I ran out of the house.

STANLEY
You were just a little boy, Josh. That’s what you’re supposed to do.

JOSH
[staring at nowhere] Yeah.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Schubert’s “Ave Maria” is playing in the boom box. Josh is sitting in his chair, 
thinking deeply. From outside, we hear C.J. knocking. Josh doesn’t answer. 
C.J., carrying a glass of wine, opens the door and walks in.

C.J.
Josh? I was knocking but you didn’t answer.

JOSH
I didn’t hear the door.

C.J.
What are you doing?

JOSH
I think I’m ready to brief the President on the smallpox article.

C.J.
Why don’t you forget about that for tonight, and come have some chili? Everyone’s 
there.

JOSH
C.J., an N.S.C. staffer gave me a card with instructions on it for what I’m supposed 
to do in the event of a nuclear attack. They want me up in the plane or down on a 
bunker. They don’t want you... or Sam, or Toby, for that matter. I didn’t want to be 
friends with you and have you not know.

C.J.
Josh, have you been upset about this?

JOSH
Yes.

C.J.
You’re very sweet sometimes. You really are.

JOSH
C.J...

C.J.
Of course, they don’t want me, Josh. I’m a press secretary. I don’t think they’re 
gonna be issuing a whole lot of releases. Sam and Toby are communications and my 
guess is that speech writing won’t be a priority either. Come, have some fun.
[starts to go to the door]

JOSH
[points at the boom box] This is a beautiful piece of music. Do you know this?

C.J.
[turns back] I’m Catholic.

JOSH
Hang on. Listen. Listen. [goes to the boom box and slowly turns up the volume. 
A high voice in the choir sings and Josh is moved] There, right there. It’s... 
miraculous. [beat] Schubert was crazy, you know.

C.J.
Yes.

JOSH
Do you think you have to be crazy to create something powerful?

C.J.
Josh, the cold war is over. There’s not gonna be a nuclear...

JOSH
God, C.J. It’s not gonna be like that. It’s not gonna be the red phone and nuclear 
bombs.

C.J.
What’s it gonna be?

JOSH
It’s gonna be this. It’s gonna be something like this. Smallpox has been gone for 
50 years. No one has an acquired immunity. Flies through the air. You get it... 
you carry a ten foot cloud around with you. One in three people die. If 100 people 
in New York City got it, you’d have to encircle them with 100 million vaccinated 
people to contain it. Do you know how many doses of smallpox vaccines exist in the 
country? Seven. If 100 people in New York City get it, there’s gonna be a global 
medical emergency that’s gonna make HIV look like cold and flu season. That’s how 
it’s gonna be, a little test tube with a-a rubber cap that’s deteriorating... A guy 
steps out of Times Square Station. Pshht... Smashes it on the sidewalk... There is 
a world war right there.

C.J.
We’ll make more vaccine. [turns to the door]

JOSH
You better hurry ‘cause I’m the only one with one of these cards.

C.J.
Come have chili. The President’s asking for you.

JOSH
Yeah, I’ll be right there in a minute.

C.J.
You really are very sweet sometimes. [exits]

Josh stares at the door.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
We follow C.J. as she walks by. White House staffers are having a good time in a 
reception while waiting for the chili. We stop at Bartlet having a conversation about 
basketball with Sam and Charlie.

BARTLET
Sam, it’s all about mastering the fundamentals, see? Got to keep your hands up, 
your feet moving on defense. Pass and get open or find the open man, and follow his 
shot on offense. See, I am a master of fundamentals, and that is why my team so 
thoroughly dominated your team.

SAM
It probably didn’t hurt so much to have a 2 time A.C.C. player of the week on your team.

BARTLET
[walks away] Leo, kids don’t understand the fundamentals.

LEO
No appreciation for the game, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Mrs. Landingham, are you drunk?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[carrying a bottle of beer] No, sir. Now why would I...

BARTLET
I just like asking.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know, I should tell you...

BARTLET
Oh, give it up. Where’s Zoey? [takes beer from Mrs. Landingham]

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[takes back her beer] She’s in the kitchen.

On the OTHER ROOM, C.J. talks with Toby, Cathy, and Donna.

C.J.
Wolves don’t kill people. That’s a myth.

TOBY
Where along the way did she turn into a wolf person?

C.J.
More people get killed getting change out of vending machines than get killed by 
a wolf attack.

CATHY
Are you serious?

C.J.
Number of people killed last year retrieving change from a vending machine: four. 
Number of people killed by a wolf attack: zero.

TOBY
[sees the President in the other room] Excuse me. One second.

DONNA
How do people die from vending machines?

TOBY
[sits across Bartlet] So, I guess we haven’t been getting along too well lately. 
Have we, sir?

BARTLET
No, I guess not.

TOBY
I’ve been... irritating you?

BARTLET
Yes.

TOBY
Was David Rosen your first choice for my job?

BARTLET
[looks away] Yes.

TOBY
Well, I’m glad we had this little talk, sir. I feel a lot better. Thank you, sir.
[laughs]

BARTLET
We were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming 
at me, “Governor, for God’s sakes, it’s got to be Toby. It’s got to be Toby.” When 
I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a 
partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God... I couldn’t live without you Toby. 
I mean it. I’d be in the tall grass. I’d be in the weeds... I know I disappoint you 
sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know 
you’re right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand 
up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby... 
The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My 
demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?

TOBY
Yes, sir. I did.

BARTLET
You think that’s what’s stopping me from greatness?

TOBY
Yes.

BARTLET
I suppose you’re right.

TOBY
Tell you what though, sir. In a battle between a President’s demons and his better 
angels, for the first time in a long while, I think we might just have ourselves a 
fair fight.

BARTLET
Thank you, Toby. [beat] Now, go away.

CUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE KITCHEN - NIGHT
The President's youngest daughter, ZOEY BARTLET, is cooking chili in a big casserole. 
Behind her, Josh looks at the door window and sneaks in. Zoey, not taking a look, 
smiles as she realizes that Josh came in. From behind, Josh tries to surprise her.

JOSH
Drop the spoon!

ZOEY
I knew it was you.

JOSH
You look good!

ZOEY
And, you look like death in a triscuit.

JOSH
Oh, thanks very much. I’m seeing a new barber.

ZOEY
I heard you’ve been having a little nutty today.

JOSH
Mind your own business. [beat] What classes are you taking?

ZOEY
Mind your own business.

JOSH
Okay.

CHARLIE
[enters] Excuse me.

JOSH
Charlie, you met Zoey Bartlet?

CHARLIE
No, it’s a pleasure to meet you, ma’am. I’m Charlie Young.

ZOEY
Hi.

JOSH
Okay, hang on a second. Let’s take it back a moment and give it another chance. 
This is a girl, Charlie. You don’t have to call her “ma’am.”

CHARLIE
I beg your pardon. Did I call you...

ZOEY
Zoey.

CHARLIE
I should call you Zoey?

ZOEY
[smiles] If I can call you Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes... Um, I have a message for you from the President.

JOSH
That would be her father.

CHARLIE
You’re forbidden from adding additional cumin to the chili.

ZOEY
Charlie, check the door to see if my father’s nearby?

CHARLIE
Ma’am, I...

JOSH
Ah, ah, ah. [looks out the door]

CHARLIE
Zoey, I have certain instructions, and I don’t want to get in trouble...

JOSH
You’re fine.

ZOEY
Taste this. [offers Charlie a taste] Doesn’t it need cumin?

CHARLIE
It needs oregano.

ZOEY
Well, let’s get to work.

JOSH
See, you guys. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT
We see C.J. still talking about wolves and vending machines, this time with Leo and 
the President.

C.J.
I don’t know. I mean, maybe the vending machines fall on them while they’re getting 
their change.

Bartlet and Leo laugh.

C.J. [cont.]
My point is, can’t we build schools and protect wildlife at the same time? We must 
be able to do that.

LEO
Pluie really got to you, huh?

C.J.
She really was very sweet, Leo.

Josh joins in the conversation as C.J. leaves.

BARTLET
Josh! We’ve been looking for you.

C.J.
[to Leo] I’ll be over here.

BARTLET 
Look at this, will you?

JOSH
At what sir?

BARTLET
I don’t know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues, 
enjoying each other outside work.

JOSH
So, what were you guys talking about?

BARTLET
We were talking about these women.

JOSH
Yeah?

LEO
We can’t get over these women.

BARTLET
Look at C.J.

We see a glimpse of C.J. laughing and talking to Sam and Donna, while holding a 
Polaroid.

BARTLET [cont.]
She’s like a fifties movie star, so capable, so loving and energetic.

LEO
Look at Mandy over there.

Mandy, on the other side of the room is fighting with Toby about something.

LEO [cont.]
Going punch for punch with Toby in a world that tells women to sit down and shut up. 
Mandy’s already won her battle with the President. The game’s over, but she’s not 
done. She wants Toby.

BARTLET
Mrs. Landingham.

Mrs. Landingham is having fun while talking to some staffers.

BARTLET [cont.]
Did you guys know she lost two sons in Vietnam? What would make her want to serve her 
country is beyond me, but in 14 years, she’s not missed a day’s work, not one. [beat]
There’s Cathy, Donna, and Margaret.

JOSH
Mr. President, there’s something that’s been bothering me for most of the day, and 
while I know that this is an inappropriate time...

LEO
No, what’s on your mind, Josh?

JOSH
I serve at the pleasure of the President, and it’s a great privilege that I will 
never forget. [takes out the card from his wallet, a card that has bothered him for 
the whole day. He shows it to Leo and the President.] I can’t keep this. I think 
it’s a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in tragedy. 
And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And for all the times in 
between, I just want to be able to look them in the eye. Leo, it’s not for me. I 
want to be with my friends, my family, and these women.

Bartlet pats Josh on the back. From the other side, we see Zoey and Charlie come 
in the room. Charlie signals the President that the chili is done. Bartlet starts 
to silence the room.

BARTLET
Uh, excuse me! Thank you. Uh, friends, please... Well, chili’s ready and I hope 
you all enjoy it. In fact, since I told you you would enjoy it, I’m reasonably 
certain that you will. 

Laughter.

BARTLET [cont.]
You know, of course, the first lady’s in Pakistan. [starts to walk around the room]
I’m not entirely sure why, but I have learned it’s a pretty good idea not to ask my 
wife too many questions as it seldom leads to anything but further confusion. I miss 
her very much, but I’m delighted our beautiful daughter, Zoey is here. You know, 
she’s starting Georgetown in the spring.

Everyone claps their hand for Zoey.

BARTLET [cont.]
This, prior to medical school and a life of celibacy.

JOSH
Yeah, right!

BARTLET
It’s an incredible adventure you’re starting on, sweetheart. An amazing four years 
full of people and experiences you haven’t yet dreamed of. And if you will allow me 
just one minute of business, please. I hope that by the time we’re done with our 
four years here, we’ll have seen to it that every young person who chooses can go 
to college and beyond, regardless of their economic status.

Applause.

BARTLET [cont.]
I understand that today was another one of Leo’s “big block of cheese” days!
You all start out so cynical, but it never fails. By the end of the day, there’s 
always one or two converts, right? And today was no exception. C.J. Cregg is gonna 
be up all night writing a position paper for the interior department on the 
necessity of wildlife protection. [C.J. laughs.] C.J., I don’t mind the cost of 
this wolves-only highway. It’s the segregation. The ACLU is gonna file a petition 
on behalf of some reindeer and then we’re all screwed.

Everyone laughs.

BARTLET [cont.]
Sam Seaborn had a guy who spotted a UFO today, am I right? Sam laughed him out of 
his office, but you’ve been thinking about it ever since. But you can rest assured, 
Sam. It was not a spaceship from another planet, just another time. A long since 
abandoned Soviet satellite, one of its booster rockets didn’t fire and it couldn’t 
escape the earth’s orbit--a sad reminder of a time when two powerful nations 
challenged each other and then boldly raced into outer space. [beat]
What will be the next thing that challenges us, Toby? [looks at Toby] That makes 
us work harder and go farther? You know, when smallpox was eradicated, it was 
considered the single greatest humanitarian achievement of this century. Surely, 
we can do it again. As we did in the time when our eyes looked towards the heavens, 
and with outstretched fingers, we touched the face of God. [beat] Here’s to absent 
friends, and the ones that are here now. [holds up his glass of wine]

STAFF
Cheers!

Everyone in the room hold up their glasses in unison.

West Wing S01E06
Toby (Richard Schiff) and Mandy (Moira Kelly) work to convince some congressmen -- including the nervous Mr. Willis (Al Fann), who assumed his late wife's office -- to approve a commerce bill that includes a vital census-counting provision. The President's daughter, Zoey (Elizabeth Moss) gets into an ugly fracas in a Georgetown bar along with Josh (Bradley Whitford) and Sam (Rob Lowe). Elsewhere, C.J. (Allison Janney) swallows her pride and asks Sam for help to understand the basic components of the administration's stance on random census-taking in 2000, and a peeved President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) scolds Leo (John Spencer) when he learns that Leo's wife has left him.

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Bartlet and his staff are gathered around a table, playing poker. C.J. is dealing 
the cards.

C.J.
Nine, no help. Jack, no help. Eight, possible flush. King, possible flush. Ace, no 
help. Six, possible straight. Dave of love for the dealer. Ace bets.

MANDY
Check.

SAM
Check.

C.J.
Check.

LEO
Check.

JOSH
Check.

TOBY
[pause] Check.

There’s a long silence.

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
There is one fruit...

The President’s staff groans.

TOBY
Oh please...

BARTLET
There is one fruit...

TOBY
Mr. President, check or bet sir. Those are your choices.

BARTLET
There is one fruit...

JOSH
Or you should feel free to give us a quiz on inane trivia.

BARTLET
There is one fruit whose seeds are on the outside. Name it please.

C.J.
Is it the kumquat?

BARTLET
No.

Everyone laughs.

TOBY
Check or bet sir?

BARTLET
I bet five.

MANDY
Call.

SAM
See it.

C.J.
Fold.

LEO
See it.

JOSH
Call.

TOBY
I see it. And I raise you five.

EVERYONE
Oooh...

LEO
Trouble...

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
It’s the strawberry.

EVERYONE
Ah.

MANDY
Oh right.

TOBY
Well, thank you sir. I just raised your bet.

BARTLET
Yes you did Toby, and I thought it was a bold move when you consider that Leo’s 
holding the six you’re looking for.

TOBY
Do you call the raise sir?

BARTLET
That depends...

JOSH
Depends on what?

BARTLET
There are fourteen punctuation marks in Standard English grammar. Can anyone name 
them please?

C.J.
Period.

JOSH
Comma.

MANDY
Colon

SAM
Semi-colon.

JOSH
Dash.

SAM
Hyphen.

LEO
Ah... apostrophe.

BARTLET
That’s only seven. There are seven more.

TOBY
Question mark, exclamation point, quotation marks, brackets, parentheses, braces 
and ellipses.

C.J.
Ooh.

JOSH
Wow!

TOBY
Do you call the raise sir?

BARTLET
There are three words, and three words only in the English language that begin with 
the letters DW.

JOSH
This is a pretty good illustration of why we get nothing done.

All laugh.

BARTLET
Can anyone name them for me please?

SAM
Three words that begin with DW?

BARTLET
Yes.

SAM
Dwindle.

BARTLET
Yes.

TOBY
Dwarf.

BARTLET
Yes.

Everyone mumbles out different words.

TOBY
[to Sam] C’mon Princeton. We’ve got dwindle, we’ve got dwarf. 

BARTLET
I see you five and raise you five by the way.

TOBY
Dwarf... dwindle.

LEO
Fold.

JOSH
Fold.

C.J.
Last card down.

BARTLET
“Witches brew a magic spell, in an enchanted forest where fairies...”

TOBY
Dwell! Dwell, dwell! Dwindle, dwarf and dwell!

BARTLET
Well, the answer’s correct but let’s check with our judges and -- oh no, I’m sorry, 
time’s expired.

TOBY
What? What time?

BARTLET
My time.

JOSH
You have your own time?

Everyone laughs.

TOBY
I call.

BARTLET
Trip nines.

EVERYONE
Ooh...

TOBY
Take your money sir. You’d dwell to report that to the I.R.S., report you as I will.

LEO
All right, I’m done. I’m gonna head home.

BARTLET
Kiss Jenny for me.

LEO
Yeah, I will.

The staff begins to leave.

JOSH
Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me. 
What are you doing?

SAM
I was gonna go home.

JOSH
Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me. 
What are you doing?

SAM
I’m going to go back to your office with you and make sure you understand the 
commerce report.

JOSH
Thank you.

SAM
When I get through with you you’re gonna know everything there is to know about 
standard data versus sampling data in the census.

Bartlet and Leo walk into THE OVAL OFFICE. Charlie is seated on the couch.

BARTLET
Charlie, I’m headed over to the residence, you’re done for the night.

CHARLIE
Thank you sir. I’m gonna stay a bit to do some paperwork.

BARTLET
Don’t stay up too late son.

C.J.
[to Mandy as they walk in] How’d you do?

MANDY
84 bucks.

C.J.
Most of that’s mine.

A door closes somewhere...

MANDY
What’s that?

Suddenly several Secret Service Agents burst into THE OVAL OFFICE.

AGENT
Excuse me Mr. President. I’m sorry the building’s not secure. Would everyone stay 
in the room please?

Sam and Josh are let in by another agent. 

JOSH
This is happening way too often.

LEO
It’s pledge week at the fraternities. The kids hop the fence.

AGENT
Would you mind stepping away from the doors and windows please?

JOSH
This whole room is doors and windows.

LEO
Josh.

JOSH
I’m cooperating. I’m cooperating.

AGENT
This will be under control in just a minute, Mr. President.

BARTLET
All right. [long pause] What body of water in South America is formed by the 
confluence...?

TOBY
Excuse me Wink Martindale? Do you really think this is the time?

BARTLET
Not quite up on your South American geography are you my friend?

AGENT
We’re clear.

BARTLET
Saved by the bell.

MANDY
This is exactly the kind of thing that didn’t used to happen at my old job.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Toby walks in. Cathy and Bonnie are in their desks.

TOBY
Cathy, I need a copy of Article 1, Section 2.

CATHY
Article 1, Section 2 of what?

TOBY
The Constitution.

CATHY
Is that something I’m supposed to have at my desk? 

TOBY
Does anybody have a copy of the Constitution? [No one responds.] This is discouraging.

CATHY
Bonnie, would you get Toby a copy of the Constitution?

BONNIE
Is it still in print?

TOBY
Oh for crying out loud! Try Amazon.COM. If they don’t have it then just bust into 
the glass display case at the National Archives!

C.J.
[comes up from behind] You shouldn’t yell.

TOBY
Is it still in print, is what my staff would like to know.

C.J.
I’m here to see Sam.

TOBY
Go ahead.

C.J.
It’s not a big deal, I’m just, you know, here to see him about something.

TOBY
What do I care?

C.J.
Absolutely no reason that you should.

TOBY
Okay.

Toby walks into his office as C.J. walks into SAM'S OFFICE. Sam is busy talking 
on the phone.

SAM
[into phone] ...And the President’s committed to vetoing any Commerce Bill that 
prohibits sampling data as a legitimate component of the 2000 Census, and I’m not 
saber rattling Jill, I’m just giving you a preview of what you’re gonna get later 
with Toby. Yeah. I’ll see you then. [hangs up and sees C.J.] Hey.

C.J.
Hey. That was all great... what you just said there. 

SAM
What’d I just say?

C.J.
Not so much what you said, but the way you said it. 

SAM
The census has to be taken seriously.

C.J.
Tell me about it.

SAM
You know... It’s not glamorous, but you know.

C.J.
Sure.

SAM
You need something?

C.J.
Did you get a haircut?

SAM
No.

C.J.
You look good today.

SAM
Thank you. You too.

C.J.
New suit?

SAM
No.

C.J.
You look good.

SAM
What do you need C.J.?

The two start walking from the office to the HALLWAY. 

C.J.
A tutor.

SAM
A tutor?

C.J.
Yes.

SAM
What for?

C.J.
Sam, I read my briefing book last night on the commerce bill regarding the census 
and there are certain parts of it I don’t understand.

SAM
I can help you out. Which parts?

C.J.
Well... all of it.

SAM
All of it?

C.J.
Yes.

SAM
You don’t understand the census?

C.J.
I don’t understand certain nuances.

SAM
Like what?

C.J.
Like, the census.

SAM
C.J., we’ve been working on this commerce bill for three weeks, I hear you talk 
about the census all the time.

C.J.
Yeah. Yeah.

SAM
Well...I don’t understand. How could you-?

C.J.
I’ve been faking it.

SAM
You’ve been faking it?

C.J.
I’ve been playing it fast and loose there’s no doubt about it, but sitting in on 
some of the meetings we’ve been having, and reading the briefing book last night, 
I have to say that the census is starting to sound to me like it’s, well, important.

SAM
Ah-ha.

C.J.
And, I’ve come to the realization that if I’m gonna be talking about it all week, 
it’s probably best that I understand what I’m saying.

SAM
When?

C.J.
When what?

SAM
When did you come to this realization?

C.J.
About an hour ago.

SAM
Okay. Let’s... I tell you what, let’s forget the fact that you’re coming a little 
late to the party and embrace the fact that you showed up at all.

C.J.
That’s what I say.

SAM
Let’s try it at lunch.

C.J.
Thank you.

SAM
You’ve been faking it?

C.J.
Yes.

SAM
To the President?

C.J.
I know. I probably shouldn’t do that.

SAM
You think?

C.J.
I’ll see you at lunch.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Josh is standing at a file cabinet. Donna comes up from behind him.

DONNA
Hi.

JOSH
Hi. [starts walking, Donna following]

DONNA
Can I ask you a question?

JOSH
About what?

DONNA
The budget surplus.

JOSH
Go ahead.

DONNA
There’s a 30 billion dollar budget surplus.

JOSH
It’ll actually shake out to about 32 billion.

DONNA
Whatever.

JOSH
Well, you know what they say?

DONNA
What do they say?

JOSH
A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there. Sooner or later it starts to add 
up to real money.

DONNA
That’s a nifty saying Josh.

JOSH
I didn’t coin it or anything.

DONNA
We have a 32 billion dollar surplus for the first time in three decades.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Republicans in Congress want to use this money for tax relief right?

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Essentially what they’re saying is, they wanna give back the money.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Why don’t we wanna give back the money?

JOSH
‘Cause we’re Democrats.

DONNA
But it’s not the government’s money!

JOSH
Sure it is. It’s right there in our bank account. 

DONNA
That’s only because we collected more money than we ended up needing.

JOSH
Isn’t it great?

DONNA
I want my money back.

JOSH
Sorry.

DONNA
We’re not done with this.

JOSH
I didn’t think so.

Josh and Donna enter LEO’S OFFICE. Toby, Cathy, Mandy, Sam and Leo are gathered 
there. They are reading the Appropriations Bill. 

LEO
Twelve million dollars to establish an Appalachian transportation institute. 1.5 
million to study parking facilities at commercial truck stops. Three million dollars 
to produce a documentary on highway infrastructure. These are just some of today’s 
additions to the Appropriations Bill. And that’s just in the area of transportation.

MANDY
Two million dollars for a volcano monitor in Alaska to warn passing airplanes about ash?

LEO
By the way, the FAA doesn’t know what that is!

TOBY
550,000 dollars for New York State to restore the home of Susan B. Anthony.

JOSH
While we’re at it, the tile in my shower could use re-grouting.

MANDY
Could somebody please remind me what’s in this for us?

TOBY
Power zones, US rail, and Federal funding for 100,000 new public school teachers.

MANDY
Thank you.

LEO
How’s this working?

MANDY
We have a meeting with Gladman and Skinner, and they represent two of the three swing 
votes on the Commerce Committee. 

LEO
Swing votes in terms of the census?

MANDY
Yes. And if they agree to drop the sampling prohibition, the Appropriations Bill 
could pass without a problem.

LEO
Who’s the third?

MANDY
The third?

LEO
You said three swing votes... Gladman, Skinner...

TOBY
Janice Willis’ husband.

LEO
Right.

TOBY
Presumably he’s gonna do what he’s told.

MANDY
We’re fine.

LEO
You sure?

TOBY
Tomorrow’s the start of a three-day weekend and 435 congressmen want to make their 
flights home in the morning.

LEO
You think that’ll do it?

TOBY
Oh, I know that’ll do it.

LEO
What time’s the meeting?

TOBY
11 o’clock.

LEO
Just don’t do anything to screw up or in any way embarrass me okay?

JOSH
Leo. Knute Rockne. Sometimes I get them mixed up. 

LEO
Go.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and the head of the Secret Service, RON BUTTERFIELD, are seated on the couch.

RON BUTTERFIELD
If they hop the fence, they’re going to jail. What they do once we get to them is 
what’s gonna determine for how long.

BARTLET
What tripped the alarm?

RON
Well, there are alarms in the ground. [pointing to a map on the coffee table]
Here, here, here here, here, here, and here. She tripped it here.

BARTLET
She?

RON
Yes sir.

BARTLET
It wasn’t a fraternity stunt?

RON
No sir. It was a mentally unbalanced woman in her forties.

BARTLET
Well, you know, just trying to kill me isn’t necessarily evidence of being mentally 
unbalanced!

RON
Sir, it appears from her statement...you weren’t the target.

BARTLET
I wasn’t?

RON
No sir.

BARTLET
Who was?

RON
Your daughter.

BARTLET
Zoey?

RON
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
[enters] Good morning Mr. President.

BARTLET
You know Ron Butterfield?

LEO
Sure.

BARTLET
He says it was a woman!

LEO
We spoke last night.

RON
We’re still reviewing the frame-by-frame, Leo. 

LEO
I’ll get a report first thing?

RON
Yes sir. Mr. President, if I could excuse myself to the outer office I could make 
a call and see...

BARTLET
Of course. [to Leo] This woman was after Zoey?

Ron leaves.

LEO
There were eight security checks between where the woman was and Zoey’s bedroom.

BARTLET
There’s no need for Zoey to know about this right? 

LEO
No.

BARTLET
What do you need?

LEO
This may be the wrong time Mr. President, but I wanted to speak to you about...
As the game was breaking up last night, you mentioned I should say hello to Jenny.

Ron Butterfield walks back into the room.

BARTLET
Hang on a second. What’ve you got Ron?

RON
You’ll be happy to know our security system worked exactly the way our security 
system’s supposed to work.

BARTLET
Well, I guess that’s something.

RON
Yes sir.

LEO
You’ll send the full report?

RON
About two hours.

BARTLET
[to Leo] You were saying?

LEO
It can wait.

BARTLET
You sure?

LEO
Yeah. Good seeing you Ron.

RON
Thank you.

LEO
I’ll see you in an hour sir.

BARTLET
[to Leo] All right, thanks. [to Butterfield] I guess we’re done too.

Leo leaves.

RON
I wouldn’t lose a lot of sleep over it sir. 

BARTLET
No, no.

RON
Good seeing you Mr. President.

BARTLET
You too. [pause] Ron?

RON
Yes sir?

BARTLET
Did she have a gun?

RON
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Thank you.

Ron Butterfield leaves.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Mandy and Josh are seated inside pouring coffee. Congressmen GLADMAN, SKINNER and 
JOE WILLIS walk in.

GLADMAN
Josh, good to see you.

JOSH
Congressman.

SKINNER
Morning.

JOSH
Morning.

GLADMAN
Mandy, if I’d known you were going to be here I would have brought my sword and shield.

MANDY
Champagne and flowers would’ve done the trick.

GLADMAN
Have you met Joe Willis?

JOSH
No, we haven’t.

WILLIS
My wife was Janice Willis.

JOSH
I know.

WILLIS
She passed away last month, so I’ve taken over her seat in Congress.

MANDY
Yes sir, we know. We’re so sorry for your loss.

WILLIS
The White House sent flowers and the President wrote a very beautiful note. I wonder 
if you could pass along my thanks. 

JOSH
We sure will, congressman.

WILLIS
Please, no, I’m not a congressman. I teach 8th grade social studies. This is only 
temporary so...

Toby enters with entourage. Cathy and two other staffers are with him. They have 
with them a bunch of copies of the Appropriations Bill.

TOBY
Morning. Everyone got fruit. Everyone got bagels. Good, good. Christopher, Anthony, 
would you mind putting my copy of the Appropriations Bill on the table please. 
Thank you Christopher, thank you Anthony, and thank you Cathy. Gentlemen, why don’t 
we take our seats? Congressman Skinner, welcome. Congressman Gladman, always good 
to have you here, sir. Congressman Willis, I was a great fan of your late wife.

WILLIS
Thank you.

TOBY
This represents the latest draft of the House Appropriations Bill. It is 7,000 pages 
long, and weighs over 55 pounds. It includes 1.2 million dollars for a lettuce 
geneticist in Salinas, California and 1.7 million dollars for manure handling in 
Starkville, Mississippi.

GLADMAN
Toby, you know that’s what happens.

TOBY
Eight states will divide 5 million dollars to research the uses of wood.

SKINNER
Yeah we saw that one!

TOBY
I’m thinking of some uses for it right now.

GLADMAN
I thought we were here to talk about the census? 

JOSH
We are. The White House just wanted to take this opportunity to point out that you’re 
criminals and despots.

GLADMAN
Thank you.

JOSH
No problem.

GLADMAN
But that’s not going to stop the President from signing the bill into law?

JOSH
No, sadly it won’t. What will stop the President from signing the bill is the amendment 
your committee is offering on the census.

MANDY
The three of you represent the swing vote on the Commerce Committee. You drop the 
census amendment and the Appropriations Bill goes through without a hitch. Insist on 
the law prohibiting sampling and you can count on a long floor fight followed by an 
almost certain veto.

TOBY
I would like to emphasize the long floor fight of it all, and remind you that I have 
absolutely no conscience when it comes to exploiting the fact that you have non-
refundable airline tickets for the weekend. With that in mind...

WILLIS
Ah excuse me.

TOBY
Yes sir?

WILLIS
I’m not leaving town.

TOBY
I’m sorry?

WILLIS
I’m not leaving town this weekend. I was gonna stay and see some of Janice’s friends. 
So, there’s no need to rush on my account. You can take as much time as you like.

TOBY
[long pause] Good, then. Let’s talk.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Sam are walking towards her office.

C.J.
And you’re gonna go slowly right?

SAM
Yes.

C.J.
Pretend for the purposes of this conversation that I’m dumb.

SAM
Let me try to conjure an image of you as a stupid person.

C.J.
You’re cracking wise. I’m coming to you exposed and vulnerable.

SAM
This is your office. I’m coming to you.

C.J.
I meant symbolically.

SAM
Ah.

They enter C.J.’S OFFICE and both sit.

C.J.
I’m a person saying there’s something I do not know, will you teach me. It’s hard 
to admit you don’t know something. That makes me submissive.

SAM
What is it exactly that you’re asking me to do?

C.J.
I’m admitting to you that there are things I do not know.

SAM
And I’m telling you that I don’t think anybody would have any trouble imagining that 
there are things you do not know.

C.J.
Explain it to me.

SAM
The Constitution mandates that every ten years we count everybody.

C.J.
Why?

SAM
Because representation at the various levels of the government, federal, state and 
municipal, is based on population. The only way to find out how many congressmen 
California gets is to count the people in California. Got it?

C.J.
Can I just say that if the briefing book had been written that clearly, I would have 
easily understood?

SAM
We’re not through yet.

C.J.
Okay.

SAM
The decennial census has always been done by a door-to-door head count. Some 950,000 
professionals are hired. The process costs approximately 6.9 billion dollars. The 
process is also very inaccurate. It tends to be significantly disadvantageous to 
inner city populations, recent immigrant populations, and of course the homeless.

C.J.
You are a very good teacher, Sam. I want you to know that in this...

SAM
Your time of vulnerability?

C.J.
Yes. I appreciate it.

SAM
We’re not done yet.

C.J.
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo walks in to find Mallory there.

LEO
Oh! Hey, baby!

MALLORY
Hi, Daddy. [embraces him]

LEO
Can you stay long?

MALLORY
No. I just wanted to bring you some stuff from home.

LEO
Oh, you didn’t have to do that.

MALLORY
I wanted you to have some stuff that you like. 

LEO
I’m really fine Mal.

MALLORY
You’re okay at the hotel?

LEO
I wanted Mom to have the house.

MALLORY
But you’re gonna look for a place right? I can help you out on the weekends.

LEO
Mallory, this thing with your mother and me... it’ll blow over.

MALLORY
No, it won’t Dad. You understand that right?

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby, Josh, Mandy, and the three congressmen are still discussing the census.

MANDY
This is a one-time experiment.

GLADMAN
This is a purely partisan issue Mandy. The Democrats want to win back the house!

MANDY
I’m not gonna deny that there’s something for us to gain.

Donna comes in and whispers something to Josh.

SKINNER
No, no, no. It’s like you lost the battle but now you want to win. 

Skinner’s voice fades out as Donna and Josh leave the room to the HALLWAY. Donna 
and Josh begin another walk and talk.

JOSH
Did he say what it was about?

DONNA
No. What’s wrong with me getting my money back?

JOSH
You won’t spend it right.

DONNA
What do you mean?

JOSH
Let’s say your cut of the surplus is $700. I want to take your money, combine it 
with everyone else’s money and use it to pay down the debt and further endow social 
security. What do you want to do with it?

DONNA
Buy a DVD player.

JOSH
See?

DONNA
But my $700 is helping to employ the people who manufacture and sell DVD players, 
not to mention the people who manufacture and sell DVDs. It’s the natural evolution 
of the market economy.

JOSH
The problem is, the DVD player you buy might be made in Japan.

DONNA
I’ll buy an American one.

JOSH
We don’t trust you.

DONNA
Why not?

JOSH
We’re Democrats.

DONNA
I want my money back!

JOSH
You shouldn’t have voted for us.

Donna walks away, and Josh walks inside the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. He sees Charlie and
Mrs. Landingham.

JOSH
Hey Charlie.

CHARLIE
What’s up Josh?

JOSH
Mrs. Landingham, I got a message he needed to see me? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah, go on in.

Josh walks into THE OVAL OFFICE. Several people are in the room. 
Bartlet is on the phone. 

BARTLET
[to the phone] Yes. Yes. Of course. [to Josh] I’m on a conference call with the 
postmaster general.

JOSH
What’s it about?

BARTLET
I honestly couldn’t tell you.

JOSH
Ah.

BARTLET
Look, I want you to do me a favor.

JOSH
Of course.

BARTLET
Take Charlie out for a beer tonight.

JOSH
Take him out for a beer?

BARTLET
Yeah. The kid has no life. You’re the only guy around here he knows at all. Take him 
out for a couple of beers, you guys come back, we’ll all watch the vote in Leo’s office.

JOSH
Sure.

BARTLET
Good, thanks. Let me give you some cash.

JOSH
No sir, I don’t need-

BARTLET
[puts hand in pocket] Don’t be silly.

JOSH
I have money Mr. President. I’m fine.

BARTLET
You sure?

JOSH
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Truth be known, I don’t have any cash on me.

JOSH
It’s fine.

BARTLET
I don’t carry cash anymore. I don’t carry keys either.

JOSH
Well, I wouldn’t think you’d need them sir.

BARTLET
How’s it going in there?

JOSH
We’ll see.

BARTLET
I appreciate it.

JOSH
Yes sir. [walks back out to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE and turns to Charlie] Charlie?

CHARLIE
Yes?

JOSH
You got plans tonight?

CHARLIE
No.

JOSH
You don’t have to sit with your sister?

CHARLIE
She’s having a sleepover at a girlfriend’s. What do you want me to do?

JOSH
Have a beer with me.

CHARLIE
What do you mean?

JOSH
Tonight. We’ll go to a bar in Georgetown. We’ll speak as men do.

CHARLIE
We will?

JOSH
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Um... What kind of bar is this Josh?

JOSH
No... It’s fine.

CHARLIE
Okay.

JOSH
Great.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Josh, aren’t you a little old to be leering at college coeds?

JOSH
I’m a Fulbright scholar Mrs. Landingham. I don’t leer. Also, there’ll be plenty of 
grad students there.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Oh well. Good then.

JOSH
So I’ll come get you?

CHARLIE
Okay.

JOSH
Great.

Josh walks out into the HALLWAY. Mallory and Zoey come up from behind.

ZOEY
Josh!

JOSH
Hey.

MALLORY
Hey.

ZOEY
Take us with you.

JOSH
Where?

MALLORY
Out tonight.

ZOEY
Your plans with Charlie.

JOSH
How do you know I’m going out with Charlie?

ZOEY
My Dad just told us.

MALLORY
He said you should take us with you.

JOSH
The man is like a camp counselor.

MALLORY
Take us with you, Josh. Take us with you.

JOSH
Nope.

ZOEY
Why?

JOSH
These are plans among men.

MALLORY
We don’t care if you flirt with the coeds.

JOSH
There’s gonna be grad students there, can we keep that in mind?

ZOEY
Sounded kinda like an order Josh?

JOSH
Fine.

MALLORY
Bring Sam Seaborn.

JOSH
Sam’s got enough going on in his life right now without you making a booty call.

MALLORY
I’m not making a booty call. We had an interesting conversation that got interrupted, 
and I’d like to finish it with him.

JOSH
Whatever.

ZOEY
This is gonna be fun.

Mallory and Zoey leave when Josh reaches his office.

JOSH
The President’s daughter, Chief of Staff’s daughter, a Georgetown bar and Sam. 
What could possibly go wrong? [walks in]

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

C.J. and Sam are alone in the press briefing room.

C.J.
What’s the problem with a straight head count?

SAM
Head counts have proven staggeringly inaccurate.

C.J.
Why?

SAM
How’re you gonna count the homeless? There’s a large and growing population of 
people who don’t speak English. And there are plenty of people, particularly in 
the inner city, who don’t want to answer questions when you knock on their door. 
Plus it’s always been hard. Sampling, statisticians have told us, is a much more 
effective way of getting a good census.

C.J.
And what’s the legal argument?

SAM
The legal argument is it’s unconstitutional. The legal argument is it’s law.

C.J.
But if sampling’s really against the law, why would congress be trying to pass 
legislation saying sampling’s against the law?

SAM
You see how good it feels to understand what you’re talking about?

C.J.
And you see I’m able to do it without being patronizing?

SAM
What happened to “You look good today?”

C.J.
I got over it.

JOSH
[comes in] Sam?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
I’m taking Charlie for a beer tonight before the vote. Zoey and Mallory are coming.

SAM
Sounds good.

C.J.
I like beer.

JOSH
If you want to come... I guess that’d be okay.

C.J.
Why, Josh, you’ve swept me off my feet.

JOSH
Whatever. I’ll see you later. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby, Mandy, Gladman, Skinner and Willis are still discussing the amendment.

MANDY
In the last census, 8 million people, mostly black, weren’t counted. And in the 
same census, 4 million people, mostly white, were counted twice.

TOBY
Sampling will give a count that bears a much greater relationship to reality and 
will do it to the tune of 4 billion dollars less than a door-to-door head count.

MANDY
Sampling will cost 2.7 billion. And an inaccurate head count will cost 6.9.

TOBY
Every single expert, including the census bureau itself, which is a bipartisan 
commission, has said sampling is better. 

GLADMAN
We’ve heard these arguments many times, but in this country we have a constitution.

TOBY
We are aware of that.

SKINNER
The Constitution’s very clear on this.

TOBY
I don’t think it is.

SKINNER
Until a court rules that sampling is Constitutional-

TOBY
The article is arcane.

SKINNER
Come on, Toby. The article is not arcane.

TOBY
Let’s take a look at it.

SKINNER
No. No. We don’t have time-

TOBY
Let’s take a look at it!

GLADMAN
Toby! None of us is a Constitutional scholar. And we honestly don’t-

MANDY
It’s not gonna take long!

TOBY
My staff managed to unearth a copy.

SKINNER
Toby, come on, we’ve been here for six-

TOBY
Mandy, would you read please from Article 1 Section 2?

GLADMAN
This is silly!

TOBY
Still, in all it is the owner’s manual and we should read what it has to say!

MANDY
[reading] “Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several 
states, which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers. 
Which shall be determined by adding the whole number of persons including those bound 
to service for a term of years.”

SKINNER
Well you said it right there. It says which shall be determined by the whole number 
of persons. The whole number of persons! Not the end of an equation that some 
statistician got off a computer. It says so right there!

TOBY
Actually that’s not what it says.

SKINNER
What do you mean?

TOBY
Mandy left out a few words. Didn’t she Mr. Willis? 

WILLIS
Yes.

TOBY
Mr. Willis teaches 8th grade social studies, and Mr. Willis knows very well what the 
article says. It says which shall be determined by adding the whole number of free 
persons. And three fifths of all other persons. Three fifths of all other persons. 
They meant you Mr. Willis. Didn’t they?

WILLIS
Yes.

TOBY
Mr. Willis, you are asking to enact a law, which will limit the ability of those 
people who need to be counted the most, to be counted as people at all. And they’re 
only refuge is the argument that Article 1, Section 2 is not arcane.

GLADMAN
Well, I think we’re through here. I can report back to the Chairman of my committee, 
but I really don’t think either he or the leadership is going to allow any one of us 
to change our vote.

TOBY
Congressman, you are talking about tying up an Appropriations Bill-

SKINNER
We don’t need you to tell us what we’re talking about, Toby. And waiting until the 
11th hour to call this...

MANDY
Excuse me! What is this, the 4th time we’ve arranged this meeting? And by the way 
it’s not...

WILLIS
I will.

TOBY
What sir?

WILLIS
I think we should drop it.

GLADMAN
Joe?

WILLIS
That’s my choice right?

SKINNER
Joe, Joe...The chairman of our committee recommends that we-

WILLIS
No. I saw what he recommended, and I appreciate his help. But it’s still my choice,
right?

TOBY
Absolutely sir. It is your choice.

WILLIS
Well, then I change my mind. I think we should drop the census amendment and let the 
Appropriations Bill go through as is.

GLADMAN
Joe...

WILLIS
Until a court rules on whether sampling is constitutional.

MANDY
Well... then... excellent.

SKINNER
Well, looks like you snuck one in the back door eh, Toby?

TOBY
It got through whatever door was open to me.

GLADMAN
Well, we’re gonna have to revisit this.

MANDY
Yes.

GLADMAN
Mr. Willis, do you need any help to find your way out?

WILLIS
No thank you. I think I can manage.

TOBY
Thank you gentlemen. Have a good weekend.

Gladman and Skinner leave.

MANDY
[to Willis] Thank you.

TOBY
[to Mandy] Go tell Leo. 

Mandy leaves.

TOBY
Mr. Willis?

WILLIS
You can call me Joe.

TOBY
If you don’t mind me asking sir, what changed your mind?

WILLIS
What do you mean?

TOBY
Well, I know it wasn’t expediency sir. I was wondering what changed your mind?

WILLIS
You did. I thought you made a very strong argument. 

TOBY
Well thank you. [laughs] I’m smiling because, well, around here the merits of a 
particular argument generally take a back seat to political tactics.

WILLIS
I can imagine.

TOBY
Yeah.

WILLIS
It worked on me.

TOBY
I was taking advantage of you sir.

WILLIS
I know.

TOBY
There are some things I did not mention. First of all, it is partisan. Second of all, 
I’m not wild about the precedent. 

WILLIS
You mean?

TOBY
What’s to stop us from saying we don’t need elections, we’ll just use polling data. 
1150 people with the sampling error of plus or minus three will decide who runs the 
country.

WILLIS
I thought about that.

TOBY
And?

WILLIS
It’s okay by me. As long as it’s not the same people who decide what’s on television. 
Toby, I’m not nearly as smart as my wife was. I went to night school cause I went to 
work pretty young. And I tried to understand the things Janice brought home from the 
office, but I wasn’t in her league. I never understood what she wanted with a dummy 
like me. [pause] I think the problems that we’re going to face in the new century 
are far beyond the Wisdom of Solomon, let alone me. But I think the right place to 
start is to say - fair is fair. This is who we are. These are our numbers.

TOBY
I’m sorry I never got to know your wife sir.

WILLIS
She would have liked you.

TOBY
Thank you. Thank you.

WILLIS
I’ve got a roll call.

TOBY
Nothing to it. They call your name, you vote yea. 

WILLIS
Well, this is my first, and likely my only vote in the House of Representatives.

TOBY
Well good luck congressman.

WILLIS
Thank you.

BARTLET
Yes?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Would you like it during the dining room? 

BARTLET
I’ll take the call wherever I am when he calls, I guess.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
There’s no need to adopt a tone Mr. President.

BARTLET
I’m not adopting a tone. I’m just trying to get out of here.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Would there be anything else sir?

BARTLET
I’m saying no. I just want to go home.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
And there’s that tone again.

LEO
[walks in] Mr. President?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Goodnight, sir. [exits]

BARTLET
Goodnight Mrs. Landingham. [to Leo] I heard it’s done?

LEO
Yeah. Commerce will leave the census amendment in committee. Appropriations will 
pass, no problem.

BARTLET
Good. I’m headed over to the residence.

LEO
I needed to speak to you about something.

BARTLET
Sure.

LEO
I should have told you earlier but... I moved out of the house. Jenny’s asking me 
for a divorce.

BARTLET
You’re kidding me?

LEO
No.

BARTLET
Leo, you’re kidding me?!

LEO
No!

BARTLET
What happened?

LEO
Nothing happened, Mr. President. It’s just one of those...

BARTLET
Don’t tell me nothing happened, Leo. I know you. I know Jenny. Married couples 
like you don’t just get divorced. Not cause nothing happened!

LEO
Nothing happened! It’s not like that.

BARTLET
I want to talk to Jenny.

LEO
Feel free.

BARTLET
I don’t understand how this happened Leo. You and Jenny were happy!

LEO
Jenny was not happy.

BARTLET
Because you weren’t spending enough time with her? 

LEO
Yes, but that’s not the...

BARTLET
Marriage needs attention Leo. It can’t run on autopilot. Come on. It’s not your 
prom date we’re talking about here. We’re talking about your family!

LEO
Well, Mr. President thank you for pointing that out. I tried to squeeze in as much 
time as I could between my wine-tasting club and running your White House.

BARTLET
You can’t blame this on me.

LEO
I’m not blaming you for it sir. I’m not blaming anyone for it. It just happened, 
these things happen.

BARTLET
When did it happen?

LEO
Two weeks ago.

BARTLET
And you’re just now telling me?

LEO
Honestly, I know how you feel about Jenny. I thought you’d think that somehow you 
were responsible for it, and you’d turn that guilt into an inappropriate anger 
toward me, which frankly, I can live without right now. [under his breath]
I can’t imagine what made me think all that...

BARTLET
[walks over to the door] Fix this, Leo.

LEO
It’s not as simple as that.

BARTLET
It IS as simple as that. You’re the man. Fix it. 

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Fix it.

LEO
[angrily] Goodnight sir.

BARTLET
Goodnight Leo.

Bartlet opens the door and heads toward the residence. Leo just stares at him and 
stands still.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT
C.J., Sam, Josh, Zoey, Charlie and Mallory are gathered around a table at a bar. 
There’s a lot of people around.

MALLORY
[to Sam] So, your friend couldn’t come tonight? 

SAM
My friend, of course you’re talking about...?

MALLORY
Your special friend.

JOSH
Sam does she know...?

SAM
My special friend.

C.J.
What special friend?

JOSH
[to C.J.] His special friend that Zoey can’t know about. 

ZOEY
The hooker!

SAM
[pause] Okay...She’s not a hooker. She’s a call girl. And how do you know about this?

ZOEY
Mallory told me.

C.J.
How does Mallory know about that?

SAM
I told her.

C.J.
You told our boss’ daughter that you slept with a call girl?

SAM
I didn’t know she was Leo’s daughter at the time. I thought she was a schoolteacher 
who came in with her class.

JOSH
So you thought you were telling a complete stranger that you slept with a call girl?

SAM
[quickly] Accidentally slept with a call girl. Mallory, does your father know?

MALLORY
No.

SAM
Zoey, does your father know?

ZOEY
Not yet.

SAM
So this is gonna be a thing!

MALLORY
Zoey and I have decided that it’s time we start collecting IOU’s.

SAM
Ah...

The waitress places some drinks on the table.

C.J.
She didn’t bring my grasshopper.

JOSH
She didn’t?

C.J.
No.

JOSH
Maybe she just felt really stupid ordering it.

C.J.
The grasshopper is a perfectly respectable...

ZOEY
[standing] I’ll get it.

C.J.
I’ll get it.

ZOEY
[quickly] I want to see them make it. [to Josh] Could you hold these?

JOSH
What?

ZOEY
Just lipstick and stuff. My panic button. Ruins the line of my outfit.

JOSH
Got it.

ZOEY
It’s called a grasshopper?

C.J.
Straight up.

JOSH
Make sure they make it extra thick and green.

Zoey walks to the bar.

CHARLIE
What is a panic button?

MALLORY
Oh, you don’t want to know. I’ve seen it in action.

C.J.
The President is a very protective father.

JOSH
[to Charlie] So, you having a good time tonight?

CHARLIE
Yeah. I appreciate it.

JOSH
Seems like you’re not really having a good time.

C.J.
He’s having a good time!

JOSH
Well...

CHARLIE
Do you think they know I don’t go to college?

MALLORY
Who?

CHARLIE
All these people.

C.J.
Charlie, you’re twice as smart as anyone in the room. 

CHARLIE
Yeah, but I don’t go to college.

JOSH
Relax!

C.J.
See, you keep telling him to relax with this sense of urgency...

JOSH
I just want to make sure he’s having a good time tonight.

C.J.
He’s having a good time! You relax!

JOSH
I’m not being urgent.

Meanwhile... Zoey is at the bar when three guys come up behind her, basically 
surrounding her.

GUY 1
Hey.

ZOEY
Hey.

GUY 1
Hi. Um...What’s your name?

ZOEY
What?

GUY 1
I said what’s your name?

ZOEY
You’re kidding right?

GUY 3
Hey, he’s just asking for your name.

ZOEY
I’m...

GUY 1
Wait. Wait. Why don’t we guess your name? All right? 

ZOEY
Sure.

GUY 2
All right, all right. Cause I bet we can guess it.

Back at the table...

JOSH
I wouldn’t say that there was urgency in my voice. I was simply asking if he was 
having a good time, and suggesting that if he relaxed...

C.J.
Well, maybe if you stopped pestering him like you were his great Aunt Ida...

CHARLIE
Excuse me one second. [stands and walks to the bar]

C.J.
Do you see what I’m saying?

Back at the bar...

ZOEY
It’s Cassandra!

GUYS
Cassandra! We were gonna guess. You ruined it.

CHARLIE
[coming up] Is everything all right, Zoey?

GUY 2
Hey. He just called her Zoey.

CHARLIE
Come on, let’s go back to the table.

GUY 1
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What’s up Sammy?

CHARLIE
Zoey?

Zoey moves towards Charlie and the guys block her.

GUY 1
Excuse me. Excuse me. We’re just trying to buy the girl a drink man.

CHARLIE
She’s 19 years old man. You’d have to take her to Maryland.

GUY 3
Check out super fly.

ZOEY
Hey!

CHARLIE
Let’s go.

GUY 1
No. Why don’t you go? Alright?

CHARLIE
Look guys. You don’t know who this is. You don’t want any trouble. Just be cool 
alright?

GUY 1
Be cool.

CHARLIE
Yeah. I’m just saying, I’m looking out for you. 

GUY 1
I understand what you’re saying. You just want me to be cool alright?

CHARLIE
Can I buy you guys a round?

GUY 3
Like LL Cool J man, like Ice Tea.

GUY 2
Ice cube, Ice tray man.

Back at the table...

JOSH
Why must you mock a perfectly natural brotherly instinct...?

C.J.
I’m not mocking it Josh, I’m saying maybe if you left the young man alone...

Sam has been watching the bar and suddenly heads for it. 

C.J.
[standing] Josh?

JOSH
[standing] I know. [picks up the panic button and heads towards the bar]

GUY 1
Why don’t you do some of that hip-hop for us G-Funk? 

GUY 2
Dr. Huffy Puffy dread man, Dr Dolittle Man?

CHARLIE
Would you let us by please?

GUY 1
No. What are you doing here with this girl? Huh? Huh? Cause you know what, to me 
you look to be Dr. Faggot!

SAM
[coming up from behind] Hey! What the hell is going on around here?

GUY 1
Who the hell are you?

SAM
Kiss my ass. Zoey?

ZOEY
I’m fine.

GUY 1
Kiss your what fairy poppins?

SAM
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Everything’s fine.

GUY 1
Hey, you want to go?

SAM
What?

GUY 1
You want to go? Let’s do it. Right now. Come on.

JOSH
[coming up from behind Charlie] How’s everybody doin’?

GUY 1
Oh good, more fairy boys.

JOSH
Excuse me?

GUY 1
I said, more fairy boys.

JOSH
Oh, this is too good to be true.

Mallory and C.J. come up behind Josh and Sam.

GUY 2
[indicating Josh] Hey, I recognize this guy. 
[indicating Zoey] And she looks familiar too.

JOSH
Yeah. You guys don’t realize it, but you’re having a pretty bad night.

GUY 1
Oh really, and who’s gonna give it to us huh?

AGENT
Federal Agents!

As Secret Service Agents pour through the door, Josh and Sam raise their arms and 
point at the three guys near the bar.

SAM and JOSH
Right here!

The agents push the three guys against the bar as another agent ushers Zoey out.

AGENT
Shut up! I swear to God I’ll blow your head off. Everybody stand back.

GUY 1
[to Charlie] Hey, I ain’t done with you Sammy.

CHARLIE
My name is Charlie Young, jackass. And if that bulge in your pocket’s an 8-ball, 
you’ll blow your splendid Spring Break in a Federal Prison.

The agents take the guys out of the bar.

CHARLIE
[to Josh] NOW I’m having a good time.

JOSH
[tossing the panic button in the air] Well, my work here is done.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
Zoey is sitting on a couch in the White House. Bartlet is standing.

BARTLET
What happened?

ZOEY
They told you what happened.

BARTLET
Did you do anything at all to provoke these guys? 

ZOEY
Like what?

BARTLET
Were you flirting with them?

ZOEY
Dad!

BARTLET
Zoey, you flirt with guys.

ZOEY
Yes Dad, I am 19 years old. I was not flirting with these guys. And even if I was 
it certainly wasn’t justification for their behavior.

BARTLET
So what were you doing?

ZOEY
I went to the bar to get a drink.

BARTLET
What the hell were you doing drinking?

ZOEY
I was getting a drink for C.J.!

BARTLET
I’m gonna up your protection.

ZOEY
No.

BARTLET
Yes.

ZOEY
Dad?!

BARTLET
Starting tomorrow.

ZOEY
I’m starting college in a month!

BARTLET
Well you’ll have plenty of friends to walk you to class.

ZOEY
I don’t want this Dad.

BARTLET
Zoey!

ZOEY
We talked about this. I’m entitled to this part of my life.

BARTLET
You’re getting this part of your life.

ZOEY
I’m entitled to a normal...

BARTLET
Oh please.

ZOEY
Don’t “oh please” me.

BARTLET
Look, the Secret Service...

ZOEY
The Secret Service should worry about you getting shot.

BARTLET
They are worried about me getting shot. I’m worried about me getting shot. But that 
is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the 
Secret Service Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me too. My getting killed would 
be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario, 
sweetheart, is YOU getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club, 
and you get up to go to the restroom, somebody comes up from behind, puts their 
hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the back door. You’re so petrified, you 
don’t even notice the bodies of two secret service agents lying on the ground with 
bullet holes in their heads. Then you’re whisked away in a car. It’s a big party 
with lots of noise, and lots of people coming and going. And It’s a half hour 
before someone says, “Hey where’s Zoey?” Another 15 minutes before the first phone 
call. Another hour and a half before anyone even THINKS to shut down all the 
airports. Now we’re off to the races. You’re tied to a chair in a cargo shack, 
somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And I’m told that I have 72 hours to get Israel 
to free 460 terrorist prisoners. So I’m on the phone pleading with Benjamin and 
he’s saying, “I’m sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with 
terrorists, period. It’s the only way we can survive.” So now we’ve got a new 
problem, because this country no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father 
who’s out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda 
with a gun to her head. DO YOU GET IT?!

ZOEY
Yes.

BARTLET
[long pause] I’m sorry I yelled sweetheart. Forgive me. Honey, I want you to have 
your freedom and your youth. I want you to have common everyday experiences with 
girls your own age. But don’t ever forget - this is a privilege, and it is an 
experience that must be cherished beyond measure. And proper protection and 
security, though at times I admit, it’s a drag, is never too high a price to pay.

ZOEY
You’re right, I’m sorry.

BARTLET
It’s alright sweetheart. It’s alright.

They embrace. Bartlet kisses Zoey’s forehead.

ZOEY
Goodnight.

BARTLET
Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you.

ZOEY
I love you too.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is sitting on the couch in his office when Bartlet enters.

BARTLET
Don’t get up!

LEO
Good evening Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hi. Before, when I was being an idiot, there was something I forgot to say.

LEO
What?

BARTLET
I’m sorry.

LEO
Thank you.

BARTLET
I would like unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.

LEO
Without objection.

BARTLET
I don’t know what the hell was the matter with me, Leo. If there’s anything I can 
do to help, anything?

LEO
Thanks.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Josh, Charlie, and Sam are sitting around the table.

JOSH
Let me tell you something, I could have taken the two guys on the left.

SAM
Those were my guys.

JOSH
Which guys?

SAM
The guys on the left.

JOSH
The guys on the left as you’re facing the bar?

SAM
Yeah. No. No. So you’re me, and facing toward the bar? 

JOSH
Right.

DONNA
[enters with a box] Sandwiches.

JOSH
Thank you, Donna. Defending virtue is hungry work.

DONNA
I’ll be at my desk.

JOSH
Ah, Donna?

DONNA
Yes?

JOSH
How much were the sandwiches?

DONNA
$12.95.

JOSH
I gave you a twenty!

DONNA
Yes. As it turns out you actually gave me more money than I needed to buy what 
you asked for. However, knowing you as I do, I’m afraid I can’t trust you to spend 
the change wisely. I’ve decided to invest it for you.

JOSH
That was nice. That was a little parable.

DONNA
I want my money back. [leaves]

SAM
Yeah, so those were my guys.

JOSH
Okay, there’s the one guy with the blonde hair?

SAM
Facing away from the bar?

CHARLIE
There were no two guys that either one of you could have taken.

Josh and Sam look at Charlie. Bartlet opens a door and calls.

BARTLET
Josh?

JOSH
Yes sir.

Josh stands and goes into LEO’S OFFICE.

BARTLET
What were you doing taking my daughter out to a bar? 

JOSH
[pause] You told me to sir.

BARTLET
I told you to take Charlie. When Zoey said she was going I just assumed you were 
gonna go have malteds or something.

JOSH
Malteds, sir?

BARTLET
Yes.

JOSH
What is this? 'Our Town'?

BARTLET
Well anyway. Thank you for doing whatever it was you did.

JOSH
As a matter of fact, I didn’t do anything. But for what it’s worth I should tell 
you that Charlie didn’t blink before he put his body between danger and Zoey.

BARTLET
[opens the door] Charlie? Sam, you come too please.

BARTLET
[to Josh] You know, I once played the stage manager in a production of Our Town.

Charlie and Sam enter the office.

BARTLET
Charlie, you a good poker player?

CHARLIE
No sir.

BARTLET
Excellent, get your money out and take a seat.

C.J.
[enters] Is Josh being punished?

BARTLET
Punished? No.

C.J.
May I ask why not?

BARTLET
Because I said so.

Mandy and Toby enter.

BARTLET
Good evening.

TOBY and MANDY
Good evening, sir.

BARTLET
Good work both of you. You bought us some time.

MANDY
Thank you, sir.

TOBY
I understand you all had a very interesting evening. 

JOSH
Yes.

TOBY
So did I.

JOSH
What happened?

TOBY
I met an unusual man.

BARTLET
C.J., deal the cards.

TOBY
He didn’t walk into the room with a political agenda. He didn’t walk in with his 
mind made up. He genuinely wanted to do what he thought was best. He didn’t mind 
saying the words I don’t know.

C.J.
I said I don’t know to Sam just this morning and I’d like to say I’m a better person 
for it. By the way, I now know everything there is to know about the census. Go ahead,
you can ask me anything.

BARTLET
How many people live in the United States?

C.J. could not respond.

SAM
There’s some material we haven’t covered yet.

Everyone is now seated at the table except Toby, who is watching the T.V. in the 
corner of the office.

JOSH
Come on, Toby. Sit down.

TOBY
I just want to watch this.

LEO
We won it 40 votes ago.

TOBY
I just want to hear this one.

ROLL CALL [on T.V.]
Mr. Widen. Mr. Widen of Pennsylvania votes yea... Mr. Wilder. Mr. Wilder of South 
Carolina votes yea... Mr. Willis. Mr. Willis of Ohio votes yea.
 
Toby lets out a sigh of relief as the roll call continues.

ROLL CALL [cont.]
Mr. Zantowski. Mr. Zantowski of....

Original Airdate: November 3, 1999, 9:00 PM EST


West Wing S01E07
As a night's stylish state dinner honoring the Indonesian president looms in the background, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) keeps his eye on a spate of potentially explosive problems: an FBI hostage standoff with dozens of militant survivalists, a Class-4 hurricane bearing down on a carrier group at sea and an impending national trucker's strike. Behind the scenes, the gracious First Lady (Stockard Channing) prepares to host the dinner, a pushy reporter (Timothy Busfield) flirts with C.J. (Allison Janney), Josh (Bradley Whitford) and Toby (Richard Schiff) corner an Indonesian government official (Peter Kors) to ask a favor, and a surprised Sam (Rob Lowe) spies his call girl friend Laurie (Lisa Edelstein) at the event.

Nothing on the nuclear test ban treaty? [More silence.] 
No? Okay. Thank you. [gets up and walks to the briefing podium, Josh following]

JOSH
C.J....

C.J.
Man alive, do I love it when In Style magazine is issued press credentials. Mirabella 
needed to know what kind of wine is being served with the fish course. So, it’s a good 
thing I went to school for 22 years. 

JOSH
What wine are we...?

C.J.
It’s wine and you’ll drink it.

JOSH
Okay.

C.J.
What do you need?

C.J. and Josh walk out to the HALLWAY and continue the conversation.

JOSH
Sarah is picking up speed and power and has now been classified as a class four system. 
You might want to talk about preparations and contingencies.

Sure. What are we talking about?

JOSH
Hurricane Sarah.

C.J.
Sarah’s a hurricane.

JOSH
Yes.

C.J.
Where is it heading?

JOSH
Georgia and parts of the Carolinas. 

C.J.
When?

JOSH
It will hit landfall by tonight. 

C.J.
Is it serious?

JOSH
Have you ever been in a hurricane?

C.J.
No.

JOSH
Me neither, but they look pretty serious.

They go into the COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN where they meet up with Sam.

SAM
Just so you know, they’ve voted to strike.

C.J.
The teamsters?

SAM
Fifteen minutes ago. Leo’s putting them in a room.

C.J.
When?

SAM
Now.

C.J.
How long is it going to last?

Sam, Josh and C.J. walk out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
Till midnight. Taft-Hartley expires, that’s why they’re going to walk.

C.J.
There’s a state dinner tonight.

JOSH
We’ll make more food.

C.J.
Josh...

They reach C.J.’S OFFICE AREA where Toby is waiting.

JOSH
Don’t worry about it.

C.J.
[to Toby] Hey, did you know about the hurricane?

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
Everybody but me?

They all enter C.J.’S OFFICE. C.J. walks to her desk. The others fill the room.

TOBY
Listen, I want you to start preparing for something. There’s a situation in McClane.

C.J.
Virginia?

TOBY
Idaho.

C.J.
What’s in Idaho?

TOBY
There’s a property there that local law enforcements had surrounded for four days. 
A farmhouse, with anywhere from 18 to 40 Survivalists.

C.J.
Are they armed?

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
Are there kids?

TOBY
Yes.

C.J. grimaces to Sam, who puts his head down.

TOBY
The F.B.I. decided it’s a hostage situation. So, we have ourselves a whole new ball game.

C.J.
So, let me see if I have this.
[looks at Josh] A hurricane’s picked up speed and power and is heading for Georgia. 
[looks at Sam] Management and labor are coming here to work out a settlement to avoid 
a crippling strike that will begin at midnight tonight. 
[looks at Toby] And the government’s planning a siege on 18 to 40 of its citizens, 
all the while we host a state dinner for the President of Indonesia.

JOSH and TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
You got it.

Sondra walks in and tries to get C.J.’s attention.

C.J.
Amazingly, you know what I’ll get asked most often today? 

JOSH
What?

C.J.
Sondra?

SONDRA
I’m sorry, C.J....

C.J.
Black suede and velvet. Manolo Blahnik slides with a rhinestone and mother of pearl 
toe buckle.

SONDRA
[writes it down] Thanks.

C.J.
No problem.

Sondra leaves as C.J. looks at Josh, at Sam, and at Toby.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is on the phone. Radio is on about the storm.

JOSH
Low-pressure system. It’s another low-pressure system. Okay, I’m talking to the Red 
Cross. I’ll call you in about an hour... Yeah. Bye.

He hangs up and walks out of his office to JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA.

JOSH
Donnatella Moss! 

DONNA
Hey.

JOSH
A senior Indonesian deputy is coming tonight. Toby and I want to talk to him alone 
for a few minutes. I need you to find out if he can speak English and if he can’t, 
we need to get an interpreter from State.

DONNA
What’s his name? 

JOSH
Ramahedi Sumahedjo Bambang.

Conversation moves to the HALLWAY.

DONNA
Can you spell that? 

JOSH
Not correctly, no. 

DONNA
Josh...

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
I’ve got to tell you something.

JOSH
What?

DONNA
I’m not wild about this whole Indonesian thing.

JOSH
What’s the problem?

DONNA
I’ve been doing some reading on my own.

JOSH
I wish you wouldn’t do that.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
Because you tend to call some bizarre factoid from a less than reputable source and 
then you blow it all out of proportion.

DONNA
[peeved] I do not. 

JOSH
Donna...

They walk to the COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN.

DONNA
I just thought you might like to know that in certain parts of Indonesia, they summarily 
execute people they suspect of being sorcerers.

JOSH
[stops] What?

DONNA
I read it.

JOSH
They... summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers?

DONNA
They behead them.

JOSH
Sorcerers.

Josh and Donna are just on their way through THE ROOSEVELT ROOM.

DONNA
Gangs of roving people. Beheading those they suspect of being sorcerers. 
You know with... what’s that thing that Death carries?

JOSH
A scythe.

DONNA
They’re doing it with a scythe.

JOSH
Well, thanks for the head’s up.

DONNA
I thought you might like to know who’s coming over for dinner.

JOSH
You bet. 

JOSH ends up in LEO’S OFFICE. Leo enters through another door. C.J., Sam, Toby and Mandy
are already there while Leo leans against his desk.

LEO
I heard it got upgraded. 

JOSH
It’s a class 4 hurricane. FEMA’s down in Georgia with the Red Cross. The President 
should be prepared to sign some sort of federal disaster relief. What’s going on with 
the truckers?

LEO
I’m meeting with them in the Roosevelt Room in an hour.

JOSH
C.J.’s going to need to know what they’re wearing.

C.J.
Yeah.

TOBY
What’s the issue?

SAM
Two tiered hiring. 

LEO
A company divides its workforce into two bodies. Long term, full time employees, 
who enjoy top market wages and benefits, and part time, or newer full time employees 
who are paid a lower waged scale and usually get no benefits.

C.J.
But, they’re part time employees.

MANDY
But, a lot of them aren’t. A lot of the workers that management designated as part time 
are de facto full time employees while working the same amount of hours under a different 
designation at lower wages with no health or pension. 

JOSH
I’m with management.

MANDY
Imagine my surprise.

TOBY
A younger workforce puts a premium on job flexibility and they’re unwilling to make a 
long time commitments to a single company. What do you expect?

MANDY
Fair hiring practices. 

LEO
Listen. McClane, Idaho? I need someone to monitor and keep the President and me updated 
throughout the day. 

SAM
I’ll do it.

LEO
You’re going to work with Toby on the toast.

TOBY
Don’t need him.

LEO
Yes, you do.

SAM
It takes two people to write a toast?

LEO
The State Department’s very particular about these toasts. 

JOSH
I’ll assign someone from my office.

MANDY
I can do it.

JOSH
No. You can’t. 

MANDY
Why not?

JOSH
Because, you’re a political consultant and... this is an actual... you know... thing.

MANDY
Leo, please tell Josh that I can play a role in issues and it’s not going to be the 
end to this administration?

JOSH
I don’t think it will be the end of this administration, Leo. I think it will be the 
end of this republic.

LEO
Establish a contact at the Justice Department and the FBI. And keep Josh informed 
throughout the day and night. What else?

JOSH
[looks at a file] The... uh... Redskins suck.

LEO
Thank you. 

Meeting breaks up. Toby and Josh walk out to the HALLWAY. Donna was loitering around 
the meeting, smiling at Josh's comment. Toby comes up to her.

TOBY
Donna?

DONNA
Yeah?

TOBY
Did Josh talk to you about the...?

DONNA
Ramahedi Sumahedjo Bambang?

TOBY
Yeah.

DONNA
I’m on it.

TOBY
Thank you. 

DONNA
Toby, did you know that in certain parts of Indonesia they summarily execute people 
who they suspect of being sorcerers?

TOBY
Yes.

He ducks into an office. Donna looks back at Josh.

DONNA
[to Josh] You see?

JOSH
You’re all crazy.

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - DAY

Reporters and photographers are kept behind red velvet ropes on one side of the room 
as Bartlet and PRESIDENT SIGUTO of Indonesia stand between the American and the 
Indonesian flag. C.J. gets something from Bartlet and ducks out of the way.

HARRY
Mr. President?

C.J.
No questions right now, Harry.

HARRY 
A short one.

BARTLET
She’s not worried about the length of your question, she’s worried about the length 
of my response.

They all laugh. Flash bulbs pop. Bartlet talks to Siguto.

BARTLET
We’re having salmon tonight. 

SIGUTO
Yes.

BARTLET
They told you that?

SIGUTO
Yes.

More pictures taken. Bartlet smiles and turns his head for the cameras. 
Siguto just sits and stares straight ahead.

BARTLET
Yo-yo Ma is going to play. [No answer.] Some Bach concertos, I believe. 
[Still no answer.] Do you like salmon?

SIGUTO
No.

BARTLET
Well... our mistake.

SIGUTO
Yes.

Bartlet just smiles for the cameras.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam is sitting at his desk with the laptop when Toby comes in.

TOBY
What do you have so far?

SAM
Uh, we start by welcoming our friends and distinguished guests. We praise President 
Siguto for leading his country through a period that promises profound change as 
Indonesia moves from an authoritarian dictatorship towards a real democracy.

TOBY
The beginnings of a real democracy.  Let’s not get carried away. 

SAM
All right. Ah... we have been friends for over 50 years...

TOBY
Don’t... Don’t say friends. 

SAM
It’s a state dinner.

TOBY
Fine. But I don’t think we should remind people how friendly we were with dictators 
who oppressed their people while stealing their money.

SAM
How else are you going to steal people’s money?

TOBY
See, that’s good. Write that in the toast? [starts to leave]

SAM
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

SAM
You got something going on tonight with Josh?

TOBY
We got to see a guy about a thing.

SAM
Need any help?

TOBY
No. Toughen this up.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Management and Labor people are seated around the table, two of which are BOBBY RUSSO 
and SEYMOUR LITTLE. Leo barges in authoritarian and sits at the head of the table.

LEO
Thirty days with a federal mediator, you people couldn’t work this out?

RUSSO
There’s fundamental differences.

LEO
Name them.

LITTLE
It’s the same differences.

LEO
Name them again.

RUSSO
The two-tiered hiring. 

LITTLE
Leo, the trucking industry faces intense competition from Fed Ex and UPS, the railroads, 
the airlines, freight operations...

RUSSO
Seymour...

LITTLE
...For us to accept wage costs that are significantly greater than our competitors, 
would render us unable to compete...

RUSSO
You know, you’re full of crap, Seymour.

LEO
This is the White House, Bobby, it’s not the Jersey turnpike. Watch your mouth. 

RUSSO
Forgive me.

LEO
For all the danger your industry’s facing from competition, Seymour... the fact is, 
the trucks are still this country’s number one way of moving things around. Including 
food. I’m talking about produce rotting in warehouses. I’m talking about fistfights 
in supermarkets over who gets the last bar of soap. [stands] You have until midnight.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Mandy is leaning against the door as Josh walks in.

MANDY
You don’t think I can do this.

JOSH
Why aren’t you in your own office?

MANDY
I don’t have an office in this building.

JOSH
There’s a reason for that.

They walk and talk into the HALLWAY.

MANDY
The McClane police got a warrant to search this house. They had reason to believe 
there was a gun in that house that was made illegal by virtue of a barrel that was 
a quarter inch shorter than it was supposed to be. 

JOSH pours himself some coffee.

MANDY
The people in this house, who are exactly who you think they are, refused entry to 
the police. 

JOSH
Did they... refuse it politely?

MANDY
They produced weapons, if that’s what you’re asking. 

JOSH
Yes... that’s what I’m asking you. 

MANDY
It really bugs you that the President listens to me sometimes.

JOSH
Yes, but you shouldn’t take it personally. It bugs me when the President listens to 
anyone who isn’t me.
 
MANDY
Do you know why the FBI had reason to believe there was an illegal weapon in this house?

They enter JOSH’S OFFICE.

JOSH
Why?

MANDY
Because we sold it to them. 

JOSH
You know that for sure?

MANDY
Yeah. Also, there are children in there. And a lot of crossed wires between the 
Deputy Attorney General and the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in terms of 
who’s running the show. My point is, aside from everything else, this is a PR disaster 
waiting to happen. And it’s going to happen today. This is why you hired me. 

JOSH
Yeah, I was wondering why that was. 

MANDY
[chuckles] It bugs you. 

JOSH
Yes. 

Mandy walks away. Josh whispers.

JOSH
Yes.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and Siguto are sitting in chairs. Another group of reporters are standing 
across them. Cameras are again flashing. 

REPORTER
President Siguto, how are you enjoying America so far?

SIGUTO
Fine, thank you.

REPORTER
Would you mind expanding on that, sir?

He doesn’t respond. Bartlet leans over.

BARTLET
She’d like you to say a little more on the subject. 

SIGUTO
I have nothing more to say on the subject.

BARTLET
Okay.

C.J.
One more question. Danny?

DANNY
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Which one?

DANNY
Pardon me. President Bartlet... I wondered if you noticed the protestors across the 
street this morning?

BARTLET
I try not to look out my window that much, Danny. What protestors? 

DANNY
Vermeil.

BARTLET
Vermeil?

DANNY
Yes, sir.

C.J.
Danny, I’m going to cover vermeil at the briefing, that’s all folks, I got to bring 
in the next group.

BARTLET
Thank you.

As reporters are filing out, Danny and C.J. talk into the HALLWAY.

DANNY
You don’t know what it’s about, do you?

C.J.
The protestors?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
It’s about vermeil.

DANNY
What’s vermeil?

C.J.
I happen to know what vermeil is. 

DANNY
[with a chuckle] Okay.

C.J.
My one o’clock briefing is going to be about the vermeil protestors, isn’t it?

DANNY
Well, I just asked a question in front of 24 White House press reporters and you didn’t 
answer it. So, I would assume that there would be some sort of follow-up, yes.

C.J.
Thanks.

DANNY
Anytime. 

Carol passes by.

DANNY
Carol?

CAROL
Yeah?

DANNY
She’s going to need you. [walks off]

CAROL
What do you need?

C.J.
I need to know what vermeil is and why people are protesting it. 

CAROL
Vermeil?

C.J.
Yes. 

CAROL
...E-I-L?

They walk inside THE OVAL OFFICE. Leo walks up to Bartlet and Siguto, who are still 
in their chairs.

BARTLET
Leo...

LEO
Good morning, sir. 
[to Siguto] Good morning, Mr. President. Would you excuse me, Mr. President? 
[back to Bartlet] Sir, if I could...

BARTLET
Absolutely.

LEO
Thank you. 

BARTLET
[to Siguto] Would you pardon me one moment, please? [to reporters] Excuse me, folks. 

C.J. calls on Carol as Bartlet and Leo walk into LEO’S OFFICE. They whisper at the door.

BARTLET
I can’t decide if that man is boring or rude, but he’s one or the other. 

LEO
I’m sorry to hear that.

BARTLET
I’m sitting out there trying to figure out how this guy campaign for something 
and win, then I remembered--we usually rig the elections. 

LEO
There you go.

BARTLET
You think it’s important he sit at my table tonight? 

LEO
He’s the guest of honor, so it is customary.

BARTLET
Where are you sitting?

LEO
At your table, sir.

BARTLET
Where’s Toby sitting?

LEO
With C.J. and Josh and Sam.

BARTLET
Ah, that’s the fun table. 

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
What do you need?

LEO
I just wanted to let you know that we’re going to clear out a battle carrier group 
from the Norfolk Naval Yard.

BARTLET
Because of the hurricane?

LEO
Yes. It’s standard procedure. They want to get the ships out of the way. 

BARTLET
All right, fine.

LEO
And this is just in case someone asks you why we deployed an entire group in the 
North Atlantic.

Their conversation fades as they re-enter THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet sits in his chair. 
Cameras flashing, Siguto still sitting like a gargoyle.

BARTLET
Sorry to keep you waiting. [No answer.] Did I mention we’re having salmon tonight?

SIGUTO
Yes.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
We look over Toby's shoulder as he writes in long hand on a legal pad. Sam is sitting 
on Toby's couch with his laptop on his lap.

TOBY
Read this. [hands Sam the pad, which Sam reads as Toby closes the door]

SAM
“Indonesia’s constitution highlights democratic principles.” Toby...

TOBY
Read.

SAM
I know what you’re gearing up for.

TOBY
Read!

SAM
[reads] “The national ideology of Pancasila, upon which, your constitution is founded, 
includes a belief in the Supreme Being, while calling for religious tolerance.” 
I see you’ve underlined that. “Freedom of the press, freedom of assembly...” 
Toby, do you think it a good idea to invite people to dinner and then tell them 
exactly what they’re doing wrong with their lives?

TOBY
Absolutely, otherwise it’s just a waste of food. 

SAM
Toby...

TOBY
We’re not telling them how to run their lives. 

SAM
[reads again] “It’s time for your government to live up to the promises enshrined 
in the hearts and minds of your people as well as the laws of your land?”

TOBY
Friendly reminder.

SAM
Can we soften the top of this?

TOBY
No.

SAM
Something like... “As has often been said, a true friend tells another friend the 
truth and on some issues, we must speak candidly, or we could not, in all honesty, 
hold the great honor of being known the world over as Indonesia’s friend.” 

TOBY
Well... that was just about the worst writing I have ever heard.

SAM
I know. 

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is doing the briefing.

C.J.
Vermeil is gilded silver. Silver covered in gold. The White House has one of the 
largest collections in the world. 

REPORTER 1
Why the protestors?

C.J.
Well, these are 18th and 19th century French objects. Many designed by the noted 
European silversmith, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot.

We see Danny's extremely smiling face. 

C.J.
The collection is kept in the Gold Room along with the ten-arm glass cut chandelier 
which was made in England in 1785. 

REPORTER 2
C.J.? What does this have to do with the protestors?

C.J.
Nothing at all. It’s just interesting information and I thought I’d share it with you.
 
Light chuckles from the audience.

C.J.
Many workers were blinded by the mercury while making these pieces. Louis the 15th 
would melt them down to pay for his wars against his people. So, in general, they’re 
seen in some circles as a symbol of a government’s bloody and tyrannical oppression 
of its own people. We use them as centerpieces with a seasonal floral arrangement.
 
TOM
Is the President concerned this might send the wrong message?

C.J.
[stares for a moment] I’ll be honest with you, Tom. I haven’t run this by the President 
yet, but I’ll have that for you, plus the rest of the day’s scores and highlights at the 
next briefing at 4:00 or 5:00. Thank you. 

As she leaves the podium, she meets Carol.

C.J.
I won’t need a transcript of that.

C.J. walks out to the HALLWAY. where Danny catches up.

DANNY
C.J....

C.J.
You’re a rabble rouser, you know that? You rouse rabbles.

DANNY
Hey...

C.J.
I went and looked at your big vermeil demonstration. Six people in Lafayette Park 
with oak tag and magic markers. 

DANNY
I didn’t say it was Selma, Alabama, or anything.

C.J.
Six people! Six pathetic people protesting on a Friday and you just lent their weak 
and feeble voices a megaphone. What do you call that?

DANNY
A job well done.

C.J.
You’re very proud of yourself. 

DANNY
Yeah. So, what are you wearing tonight?

C.J.
What am I wearing tonight?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
Your paper wants to know what I’m wearing?

DANNY
Not my paper, that was just for me. 

C.J.
[stops] You want to know what I’m wearing?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
[slowly] Well... I’m wearing... an evening gown of... gray silk.

DANNY
Good, then. I’ll be looking forward to it.

C.J.
Well, okay. I got to go deal with the vermeil crazies. 

DANNY
See ya.

C.J.
Okay. 

C.J. thinks it over after Danny walks away.

CUT TO: INT. DINER - DAY
Sam and Laurie are eating sandwiches. Laurie has a law book in his lap, sitting sideways 
in the booth.

SAM
The point I was trying to make to Toby was that this toast is coming at the end of two 
days of policy talks. And maybe at dinner we could lighten it up.

LAURIE
Sam, I’ve got Com Law in an hour. 

SAM
Should I sit quietly?

LAURIE
Yeah, ‘cause I really need to study this. 

SAM
No problem. 

LAURIE
Thanks.

SAM
I’ll eat my sandwich.

LAURIE
Good, Sam.

SAM
I’m having a hard time deciding between the ham and cheese and the chicken salad. 

LAURIE
This might help you, the chicken salad’s mine. [brings her plate closer to her]

SAM
Yeah, but this kind of environment is basically community food, right?

LAURIE
You’re not afraid of being seen with me right now?

SAM
Because of the way you’re dressed?

She’s dressed in college wear.

LAURIE
No, not... why? What’s wrong with the way I’m dressed? No. Because of my night job, Sam. 
You’re not afraid of being seen with me?

SAM
No. 

LAURIE
Okay.

SAM
Your night job’s crummy.

LAURIE
Yes. I know.

SAM
So, you got a thing tonight? A date?

LAURIE
A client?

SAM
Yeah.

LAURIE
Yeah.

SAM
Who?

LAURIE
Sam?

SAM
I was just...

LAURIE
I thought we had a deal.

SAM
Yes.

LAURIE
Thank you.

SAM
Where’s he taking you?

LAURIE
I don’t know.

SAM
Okay.

LAURIE
No. I really don’t know, Sam. He calls me, he tells me what to wear and the rest of it 
is a big surprise.

SAM
Is this...?

LAURIE
Sam, I have class in an hour and I have not even finished...

SAM
Oh, for God’s sakes, it’s Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 US 335. You cite the precedent. 
You cite Black’s opinion for the majority.

LAURIE
[stunned at his knowledge] Thank you for that display of geek bravado. But I’d like to 
learn this myself so I can graduate from law school, practice law, and give up my night job. 

SAM
And I’d like you to learn my experience when I tell you that law school bears little 
relationship to the practice of law.

LAURIE
It bears some relationship to graduating, though, right?

SAM
Yes.

LAURIE
Then shut up.

SAM
I’m just saying. Your night job stinks.

LAURIE
Fine.

SAM
And I’m taking your sandwich.

LAURIE
Fine.

She watches him take a bite of her sandwich as she bites down on a pickle.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Two military types, Leo, Josh and Mandy, are meeting with the President.

MILITARY GUY 1
Certainly, I think we’re all agreed that militias impose an inherent threat. They are 
very well armed condreys of dangerous lunatics bent on undermining the government.

MANDY
Mr. President? Would it be inappropriate for me to join the discussion?

BARTLET
No, of course not.

MANDY
Kooks, nuts, extremists, the lunatic fringe element. This is the inevitable and 
unavoidable by product of the democracy. Such as pornography is the unavoidable by 
product of free speech. 

JOSH
Excuse me, Mr. President. These people aren’t thumbing through Hustler. They’re armed. 
They’re evading arrest and they’re holding hostages.

MANDY
We think they’re holding hostages. Plus, we’re the ones who sold them the gun in the 
first place. 

MILITARY GUY 2
Yes. It’s called a sting, Mandy.

MANDY
Yeah, but another word for it is entrapment.

MILITARY GUY 2
Oh please. Pardon me, Mr. President, but the judge is never going to-

MANDY
I’m not talking about the courts. I’m talking about public opinion. 

MILITARY GUY 1
Then this is two different conversations.

BARTLET
You want to raid this house?

MILITARY GUY 2
We don’t have to come in with guns blazing. We can simply fire tear gas through the windows.

MANDY
And tomorrow’s front page will be a screaming woman running out of a burning house with 
a baby in her arms and F.B.I. windbreakers in the foreground. Why can’t we starve them out?

MILITARY GUY 1
They’ve got like a five-year supply of food and water. To say nothing of ammunition.

LEO
Josh?

JOSH
There’s no way this’ll end good. All that’s left is to end it fast.

LEO
I agree.

MANDY
What about a negotiator?

MILITARY GUY 2
Negotiation what?

MANDY
A peaceful settlement.

JOSH
This is a stand off with federal officers. A peaceful settlement is “put your guns down, 
you’re under arrest.”

MANDY
I think it would be wise if we demonstrated that we exhausted every possible peaceful 
solution before we got all Ramboed up.
 
BARTLET
All right, Mandy. Thank you. Josh? Would you two give us a minute, please?

Josh and Mandy walk out into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. They stay there as the door closes.

JOSH
I don’t think it’s unreasonably macho for the White House to be aggressive in preserving 
democracy.

MANDY
Let me tell you something. Ultimately, it is not the nuts that are the greatest threat 
to democracy, as history has shown us over and over and over again, the greatest threat 
to democracy is the unbridled power of the state over its citizens. Which, by the way, 
that power is always unleashed in the name of preservation.

JOSH
This isn’t abstract, Mandy. This isn’t a theoretical problem. The FBI says come out with 
your hands up, you come out with your hands up. At which point, you’re free to avail 
yourself of the entire justice system.
 
MANDY
Do you really believe that? Or are you just pissed off because I got into the game?

Leo opens the door and emerges from the Oval Office, walks straight to Mandy.

LEO
Mandy, the President’s going to go with your plan. Chafey’s going to send in a negotiator. 

MANDY
Good. 

Leo walks away.

JOSH
Well, you’re in the game now.

Josh leaves. Mandy stays standing.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh is wearing a tux. Donna is tying his white bow tie.

DONNA
If you can’t explain what you’re doing now, the assumption is that you’re a sorcerer. 
If you try to run, the assumption is that you’re a sorcerer. Okay? So, if anything 
happens, the prudent thing is to stand still and calmly explain your business. 

JOSH
Well, prudent or not, once the scythe comes out, I’m probably going to haul ass.

Knock on the door. Charlie sticks his head in.

CHARLIE
Excuse me.

JOSH
What’s up?

CHARLIE
I hate to ask you this, but I need a favor.

JOSH
What do you need?

CHARLIE
My grandparents own a little house up the Georgia coast. 

JOSH
Are they evacuated?

CHARLIE
I don’t know where they are. I’ve been trying to get a hold of them all day. 

DONNA
They lost power lines in parts of Northeastern Georgia. 

CHARLIE
Um... I’m sorry to ask you this, but-

JOSH
Don’t worry about it. Donna, call FEMA, use my name. When that doesn’t work, use Leo’s name. 

CHARLIE
It’s just that they don’t get around too well. 

JOSH
We’ll find them. 

Donna is on the phone already. Josh walks down the HALLWAY. Mandy is wearing a beige 
flowered sleeveless dress with a sienna colored wrap. She spied Josh and meets up with him. 

MANDY
Hi.

JOSH
I look good tonight, don’t you think? 

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
You look good too, but I look even better.

MANDY
The FBI guy’s been in there a couple of hours. 

JOSH
Yeah?

They walk through the halls as workers are setting up floral arrangements and candles.

MANDY
You think it’s a good sign?

JOSH
I really don’t know.

MANDY
I’m asking you what you think.

JOSH
I don’t have any thoughts on it one-way or the other.

MANDY
So, what’s happening with the teamsters?

JOSH
I don’t know.

MANDY
Any news on the hurricane?

JOSH
Not that I’m aware of.

MANDY
What is it you do here exactly?

JOSH
It’s never really been made clear to me. 

Mandy chuckles. They reach the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Sam comes out of his office, 
wearing a tux with tails and also a white bow tie.

JOSH
Toby!

SAM
He’s not here.

JOSH
Hey.

SAM
We look good, don’t we? 

Josh adjusts Sam’s tie.

MANDY
You guys want to be alone? [walks off]

SAM
Hey, I’m finishing up this speech... Do you think there’s some sort of personal 
connection between President Siguto and the U.S.? You know, something from his past?

JOSH
He was once almost pushed out of an airplane by a CIA trained operator. 

SAM
I should probably leave that out.

JOSH
Yeah. I would.

Sam walks off. Josh comes out to the HALLWAY. Toby is down the hall, also wearing a tux 
with tails and a white bow tie. 

TOBY
Excuse me, Josh?

JOSH
Hey.

TOBY
Can I speak with you a moment?

JOSH
Is he in? 

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
Let’s go.

TOBY
There’s a problem.

JOSH
What?

TOBY
Mr. Minaldi!

The door of one of the offices opens, MR. MINALDI walks out.

TOBY
This is Mr. Minaldi. The interpreter from State.

JOSH
You do speak Indonesian, don’t you?

MINALDI
There’s no such language as Indonesian. Indonesians speak 583 different languages. 
I speak Javanese. Mr. Bambang speaks Batak.

JOSH
[calls] Donna!

DONNA
[comes down the hall] I know, I know, I’ve got it under control. 

JOSH
It’s 7:30, is there anyone left at state?

DONNA
No.

JOSH
Then, what are we doing?

DONNA
Well, Mr. Minaldi speaks Portuguese.

TOBY
Where does that get us?

DONNA
Well, there’s a guy who works in the kitchen who can translate Mr. Bambang’s Batak 
into Portuguese. Then Mr. Minaldi will translate it into English.

TOBY
Wait a minute... ah... Why can’t the kitchen guy translate Batak into English?

DONNA
The kitchen guy doesn’t speak English.

TOBY
You’re kidding me.

DONNA
Well, no. He speaks Batak and Portuguese so I wouldn’t look down your nose.

TOBY
Is the bar open yet?

DONNA
Yeah.

TOBY
Make this work. [walks off]

DONNA
[arranges Josh's tie and whispers] I’m sorry.

CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NORTH LOBBY - NIGHT

C.J. is in her wonderful gown of gray silk--high neckline, sleeveless, with a gray 
silk wrap, dark gray gloves to the elbow and a sparkler of a diamond bracelet. 
She stops by a waitperson.

C.J.
Excuse me. Have you seen the First Lady?

ABBEY
[yelling from the distance] C.J.!

C.J. walks to her and sure enough, ABIGAIL BARTLET is wearing exactly what C.J. told 
the press she’d be wearing. 

C.J.
Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet.

ABBEY
Nice threads girl. Showing a little décolletage wouldn’t kill you dead.

C.J.
Yes, ma’am. [giggles]

Abbey takes her arm and steers her over to some people.

ABBEY
C.J., this is Harry and Nancy O’Malley. Douglas and Barbara Coleson. And their son, 
Steven, who’s a cardiologist.

STEVEN
Nice to meet you.

C.J.
Nice to meet you all.

ABBEY
This, of course is C.J., my husband’s press secretary. She’s not married, Steven, 
and she doesn’t have a boyfriend.

C.J.
Thank you, Mrs. Bartlet. 

C.J. smiles and takes Abbey away.

C.J.
Abbey?

ABBEY
He’s a doctor, C.J. He’s heir to Coleson Technologies.

C.J.
I appreciate the thought.
 
ABBEY
So, what’s on your mind?

C.J.
I spoke to Peggy about the vermeil. You might get a few questions.

ABBEY
I’m not embarrassed by the vermeil. It’s not like we spent new money on it.

C.J.
Yes, but it’s history. 

ABBEY
It’s our history. Better or worse, it’s our history. We’re not going to lock it in 
the basement or brush it with a new coat of paint. It’s our history.

C.J.
Okay, well. Good answer.

ABBEY
You know, the truth will do it almost all the time. 

C.J.
Yes, ma’am.

ABBEY
C.J.? Cardiologist...

C.J.
Yes, ma’am. [walks on]

Abbey looks around the room and sees Leo.

ABBEY
Oh, I’m sorry. Is that Leo McGarry, or is that Fred Astaire?

Leo smiles and they meet. Leo does a suave dance move.

LEO
Fred Astaire.

ABBEY
Leo, where’s my husband?

LEO
He was caught on a call. He’ll meet you over there.

ABBEY
What’s happening with the teamsters?

LEO
They’ve been at it for ten hours.

ABBEY
What’s your confidence?

LEO
We’ll be okay.

ABBEY
Good. Mingle.

Somewhere in the reception, Mandy nervously looks around. She goes out to the
JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. Donna is on the phone.

MANDY
Anything yet?

DONNA
I’m on with the Red Cross.

MANDY
What about Idaho?

DONNA
Nobody’s calling back.

MANDY
What is going on? [gets on another phone and dials]

CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NORTH LOBBY - NIGHT
Toby, Sam, and Josh are standing in a huddle. Leo comes up.

LEO
Guys... shmooze someone for me. His name’s Carl Everett, and he’s raised a ton of money 
for us in the Midwest. Carl? I’d like you to meet...
 
CARL
Toby Ziegler... [shakes Toby’s hand]
Sam Seaborn... [shakes Sam’s hand]
and Joshua Lyman. [shakes Josh’s hand]

TOBY
Our reputations precede us.

CARL
They ought to. You three do fine work. 

LEO
Excuse me, gentlemen. [leaves]

SAM
So, how long are you in town for, Mr. Everett?

CARL
Just for the night. Let me introduce my date. Brittany?

The date turns around. It’s Laurie, and Sam becomes uncomfortable.

CARL
This is Brittany. Brittany, this...

TOBY
[hurriedly] Toby Ziegler. [shakes her hand]

JOSH
Josh Lyman. [shakes her hand] 

SAM
[puts out his hand for a shake] Sam Seaborn. 

LAURIE
Nice to meet you.

CARL
We’re going to head on over, but maybe I’ll get a chance to talk to you all later.

SAM
Great.

JOSH
Have a good time.

LAURIE
Thank you.

JOSH
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Charlie walks by, and Donna calls out to him.

DONNA
Charlie! Charlie. Your grandparents are in a shelter in Granville.

CHARLIE
Oh, man. Thank God. Thank you, Donna. You know how long they’re going to have to stay 
there for?

DONNA
Well, people are being sent back to their houses right now. Get this, the hurricane 
shifted direction.

CHARLIE
You’re kidding.

DONNA
No. It’s heading back out to the Atlantic.

Leo walks by, into C.J.’S OFFICE. C.J. is holding satellite photos of the hurricane.

LEO
C.J.?

C.J.
Leo.

LEO
What’s happening?

C.J.
It’s a whole new situation. 

LEO
It’s moving east. It’s moving back out. What kind of situation?

C.J.
For some reason, there’s a fleet of ships out there.

LEO
[stricken] Oh, God...

C.J.
Do you know about this?

LEO
They evacuated a battle carrier group out of Norfolk this morning as a standard 
safety precaution.

C.J.
They’re sitting right in the path of the hurricane.

LEO
Can they get out?

C.J.
Leo, the thing is 600 miles across. They’re locked in. How bad can this get?

LEO
Catastrophic.

C.J.
What do you want to do?

LEO
Let’s do this thing, and then get ready.

C.J.
I should start to work now.

LEO
Ah. I don’t want to tip the press. Let’s go to a party. [ushers C.J. out]

INT. FORMAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Guests are being ushered at tables by men in dress uniforms. We are taken to the 
RECEPTION AREA. In a room attached to the formal dining room, Josh is on his cellphone.

JOSH
Yeah, okay... I appreciate your call. Thank you. [hangs up]

MANDY
[comes up] Josh. I’m not hearing anything from the FBI. And I’m not hearing anything 
from Justice. It’s been about a half an hour and I can’t get any information out of Idaho.

JOSH
It’s over.

MANDY
What do you mean?

JOSH
That was Chafey. They took the house. 34 occupants, they’re all in custody. 

MANDY
What happened?

JOSH
They shot the FBI negotiator. He’s in critical condition.

Clapping in the background. 

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen... President and Mrs. Bartlet... accompanied by President and 
Mrs. Rahm Siguto.

Josh is clapping with the crowd. Mandy is numb.

JOSH
Mandy?

MANDY
I... should call... get on the phone... I’m going to throw up.

Mandy takes off. Josh claps for Bartlet, his wife, Abbey, and the guests.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. FORMAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Bartlet and Leo are walking up the elegant stairs of the dining room, supposedly after 
the salmon.

BARTLET
Without warning?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
The hurricane just shifted direction without any warning?

LEO
It’s not an anomaly, but it’s unusual.

BARTLET
I would think.

They walk inside the ELEGANT BRIEFING ROOM. Lots of computers, weather maps of the 
hurricane are inside. A captain is there.

BARTLET
Captain? How big is this carrier group? How many men and how many ships?

CAPTAIN
This battle group is made up of the aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy, which carries 
a crew of 5,000 men. Two guided missile cruisers, two destroyers, and two battleships. 
All told, it’s a little over 12,000 men.
 
BARTLET
How soon before the worst of it starts?

CAPTAIN
About 20 minutes. 

BARTLET
Is there any way I can speak with the fleet commander? 

CAPTAIN
It will take a few minutes. But we can set a hook up right here.

BARTLET
All right. Let’s do it.

CAPTAIN
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Lightning flashes outside the window. The officer leaves.

BARTLET
Any word on the FBI guy’s condition?

LEO
They’re prepping him for surgery.

BARTLET
What do I do now?

LEO
Go back to the party.

Bartlet and Leo move toward the door and two military guards open the door for them.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Amidst the very busy night in the kitchen, Toby is talking to GOMEZ, a member of the 
kitchen staff.

TOBY
Mr. Gomez... 

Camera zooms in. We see chaos as they’re serving the state dinner. Toby is with Donna, 
Minaldi, Gomez, and the Indonesian diplomat, RAMAHEDI SUMAHEDJO BAMBANG.

TOBY
Mr. Gomez, you speak Batak. Is that correct?

MINALDI
[translating] Senhor Gomez, o senhor fala Batak. Correto?

GOMEZ
Sim.

MINALDI
[to Toby] Yes.

TOBY
As you just did, you also speak Portuguese?

MINALDI
E como arabou de fazer, o senhor tambem fala Portugues?

GOMEZ
Sim.

MINALDI
Yes.

TOBY
But not English?

MINALDI
Mas nao fala Ingles?

GOMEZ
Nao.

MINALDI
No.

TOBY
Okay. Those are two pretty tough languages, Batak and Portuguese... you might want to 
take a crack at English one day, seeing as how you live here. Okay?

MINALDI
Okai. Sao linguas...

TOBY
[stops him] No. Don’t translate. 
[to Bambang] Mr. Bambang, thank you for agreeing to meet with me today.

MINALDI
Senhor Bambang, obregado por ter concorcado em vir me encortar.

GOMEZ
Bapak Bambang, saya terima kasih bapak menyetujuin ketemu beseya saya.

BAMBANG
Kembali.

GOMEZ
[to Minaldi] Nao tem de que.

MINALDI
[to Toby] You’re welcome.

TOBY
Okay.

It’s going to be a long night for Toby by the looks of his expression. Josh comes in.

JOSH
Sorry I’m late. I’m Josh Lyman.

MINALDI
Desculpem o atraso meu nome e Josh Lyman.

GOMEZ
Ma’af saya telat nama saya Josh Lyman.

Round of translations continue as Toby whispers to Josh.

TOBY
This is going to take a while.

MINALDI
Pleased to meet you.

JOSH
Are you enjoying the evening?

Translations start.

TOBY
Josh, this isn’t the best context for chit-chat. 

JOSH
Mandy is pretty upset. I didn’t do a great job. 

MINALDI
I didn’t like the salmon.

Josh is confused.

TOBY
He’s answering a question from like a half hour ago. Mr. Bambang? 

BAMBANG
Why don’t we just speak in English?

Toby and Josh are stunned.

JOSH
Donna... 

DONNA
I was told that he...

TOBY
Yes.

DONNA
You should keep in mind all the things I do right.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Should I go?

TOBY
Yes. Mr. Gomez, Mr. Minaldi, thank you for your trouble.

Donna leaves, as well as Gomez and Minaldi.

BAMBANG
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

TOBY
[beat] A friend of mine is in one of your jails. I want you to let him out. 

BAMBANG
But your friend isn’t an American.

TOBY
He’s French.

BAMBANG
Then why not let the French take care of this one?

TOBY
Because he’s my friend and the French don’t give a damn.
 
BAMBANG
The extradition process is one that might...

JOSH
We’re not talking about the extradition process. 

TOBY
What we’re talking about is that you unlock the cell, you put him in a car, and you 
drive him to the border.

BAMBANG
Your friend led anti-government demonstrations?

TOBY
That’s what he does. He teaches students how to protest. 

BAMBANG
And so you’re asking this as a favor?

TOBY
Yes.

BAMBANG
Senior aide to senior aide.

TOBY
Yes.

BAMBANG
I think you have a lot of nerve. That was a despicable and humiliating toast your 
President made. And I know you are the one who wrote it.

TOBY
[stunned, rubs his eyebrow, as he’s apt to do when flustered, tightly smiles]
Please understand that with so many people watching... with so much media coverage... 
it was important for us to make clear that the United States, with it’s commitment to 
human rights...

BAMBANG
Mr. Ziegler. Does it strike you at all hypocritical that a people who systematically 
wiped out a century’s worth of Native Americans should lecture the world so earnestly 
on human rights?

TOBY
Yes, it does. 

BAMBANG
You humiliated my President tonight, qnd for no other reason than to show off. And now 
you want me to do you a favor? Go to hell. [leaves]

JOSH
We’ll talk to the French. [starts to leave, Toby is rooted to his spot] Toby. We’ll 
talk to the French.

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - NIGHT
We hear and see the storm outside as C.J. is typing on her computer. Danny stands by the door.

DANNY
That’s a nice dress.

C.J.
You’re not supposed to be back here right now.

DANNY
KDHN in Boise is reporting an FBI agent went down on a raid on a house in McClane. 

C.J.
We’ll have a statement in 15 minutes.

DANNY
What happened?

C.J.
[gets up and walks to the door] Danny, did you hear me say we’ll have a statement in 
15 minutes? God, Danny.

DANNY
What did I do?

C.J.
When you flirt with me, are you doing it to get a story?

DANNY
No.

C.J.
Why are you doing it?

DANNY
I’m doing it to flirt with you.

C.J.
[goes back to her desk] I don’t believe you.

DANNY
I know.

C.J.
So?

DANNY
So, that’s your problem.

C.J.
Look...

DANNY
When’s Hurricane Sarah about to hit?

C.J.
You know what? You’re the one who goes around town saying that I’m too friendly with 
the press corps and that makes me a weak press secretary.

DANNY
I never said you’re a weak press secretary.

C.J.
Yeah, but you’ve been thinking it.

DANNY
I thought you did well with the vermeil scandal.

C.J.
See? You’re doing it.

DANNY
I know.

C.J.
I have work to do.

DANNY
No problem. [about to walk off]

C.J.
You really like the dress?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
All right. Whatever.

DANNY
I hope the FBI guy pulls through.

C.J.
15 minutes.

Lightning flashes as she begins typing again. Danny smiles and walks down the hall.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
The Teamsters and Labor are still at it.

RUSSO
To accept these policies means that the Teamsters Union will be significantly weakened 
in its ability to represent or retain the loyalty of younger workers and we’re not going 
to let that happen!

LITTLE
I disagree.

RUSSO
No kidding!

Bartlet walks in and slams the door. All stand.

BARTLET
How are we doing?

LITTLE
We’re at an impasse, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hungry?

RUSSO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Tired?

RUSSO
Yes.

BARTLET
Talk to me for five minutes apiece and then we’re going to settle this. 

They are about to sit.

BARTLET
Stay standing.

CUT TO: INT. FORMAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Sam is at a table eating alone. Carl Everett and Laurie walk up.

CARL
Sam.

SAM
Carl. Brittany.

CARL
Have you got just a minute?

SAM
Sure. [stands up and shakes his hand]

CARL
Can I cut to the last page?

SAM
Sure.

CARL
I think you’re someone that I could have a relationship with.

SAM
You want to have a relationship with me?

CARL
What do you think?

SAM
I cost $500 an hour.

Laurie reacts to that remark.

SAM
In the private sector. I billed out at $500 an hour.

CARL
I don’t understand.

SAM
Would you like some of my food?

CARL
Oh, there’s Todd. Excuse me. Todd? [walks off]

Sam sits and Laurie hurriedly sits next to him. 

LAURIE
I didn’t know.

SAM
What were you thinking?

LAURIE
I didn’t know where he was taking me. I told you I didn’t know where he was taking me.

SAM
He just tells you what to wear.

LAURIE
That’s right.

SAM
That’s great.

LAURIE
You know, I’m sorry, Sam. But this isn’t exactly your business. I’m not here because 
of you. I’m just here because I’m here. I would be here even if you were here or not. 
You’re just some guy who happens to know me.

SAM
[angrily] Thank you. 

LAURIE
I didn’t... you know what I mean.

SAM
No. Could you keep talking about being here and not being here until blood starts 
pouring out of my ears?

ABBEY
[walks up] Sam.

Sam and Laurie stand.

SAM
Mrs. Bartlet, good evening.

ABBEY
Are you enjoying yourself?

SAM
Yes.

ABBEY
Sam?

SAM
Yes?

ABBEY
Wouldn’t you like to introduce me to your friend?

SAM
Okay.

LAURIE
Mrs. Bartlet, I’m Brittany Rollins.

ABBEY
Abigail Bartlet. [They shake hands.]

LAURIE
It’s an honor to meet you, ma’am.

ABBEY
Oh, aren’t you sweet? I’m sorry to interrupt you. Actually, I was looking for the President.

SAM
He had to step out to the West Wing.

ABBEY
Oh.

SAM
I’m not sure why, but I could...

ABBEY
To pistol-whip the trucking industry.

SAM
Why would he?

ABBEY
Because he can’t save a gunshot victim and he can’t stop a hurricane.
[smiles at Laurie] You are thoroughly charming. 

LAURIE
Thank you.

ABBEY
Excuse me.

SAM
Yes, ma’am.

Abbey leaves. Sam sits back down.

LAURIE
That was incredible.

SAM
I’m just going to eat, if that’s okay.

Laurie still has her hand on her heart from meeting the first lady.

LAURIE
Sam...

SAM
I’ll give you $10,000 not to go home with that guy tonight.

Laurie keeps her hand to her heart, then walks away speechless.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Everyone in the room is still standing.

LITTLE
Such a broad inflationary surge would wreak havoc on the economic policies that have 
allowed the United States to enjoy an unprecedented...

BARTLET
Time’s up.

LITTLE
Actually, if I may, Mr. President. I didn’t get my full five minutes.

BARTLET
Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize 
in Economics and I’m here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you’re talking 
about. At 12:01 am, I’m using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry.

LITTLE
You can’t do that, Mr. President...

BARTLET
Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in ‘52 with the coalmine.

LITTLE
And it was struck down by the Supreme Court.

BARTLET
In 50 years, there’s a new bench and I’ll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling 
Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into 
military service. You’re going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this 
isn’t settled in 47 minutes, don’t worry. We know where to find you. [walks out]

Out in the HALLWAY, Bartlet walks by, looking at the floor.

ABBEY
I shouldn’t have stayed away so long.

Abbey is in the Oval Office doorway. Bartlet hadn’t noticed her.

BARTLET
Hey... I’m all right. [holds her hands]

ABBEY
I shouldn’t have extended the trip. I’m sorry.

BARTLET
I approved a plan for an FBI negotiator.

ABBEY
I know.

BARTLET
He’s in surgery now.

ABBEY
I know. You know, one of the things that happens when I stay away too long, is that 
you forget that you don’t have to power to fix everything. You have a big brain. 
And a good heart. And an ego the size of Montana. [They both snicker.] You do, Jed. 
You don’t have the power to fix everything. But I do like watching you try.

They hug tight. We hear the thunder outside. The dim, flicker, and then goes out for a moment. 

BARTLET
What the hell? Well, if this isn’t a metaphor for powerlessness, I don’t know what is. 
We better get back to work, huh?

They walk down the hall hand in hand.

CUT TO: INT. FORMAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Leo comes down the stairs as Bartlet and Abbey are going to go up.

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
We got the fleet commander?

LEO
Not yet. The JFK’s radios have been knocked out along with communications on the Normandy 
and the South Carolina. All we’ve got is the Hickory. It’s a little maintenance and supply 
boat that sails around with the fleet.

They walk into the ELEGANT BRIEFING ROOM. Everyone’s there already. Mandy, Toby, Josh, Sam,
the captain and several guards. Bartlet walks to a table with Abbey and Leo. 

BARTLET
So, I guess I’m going to talk to the Captain of the Hickory?

JOSH
The intercom’s been knocked out. They’re looking for him on foot, sir.

BARTLET
Is there somebody on there now? [points to the radio]

LEO
The kid in the radio shack.

BARTLET
You’re kidding.

CAPTAIN
No sir.

ABBEY
Jed, talk to the boy.

The Captain pushes the speaker phone button.

BARTLET
Hello? [pause] Hello? Anyone there?

MAN [on the phone]
This is the U.S.S. Hickory.

BARTLET
Hickory, this is the White House. Who am I speaking to?

MAN [on the phone]
This is Signalman Third Class Harold Lewis.

BARTLET
Son? This is President Bartlet. [No answer.] Hello?

HAROLD LEWIS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Is your C.O. around?

HAROLD
Sir, they’re getting him right now, sir.

BARTLET
Can I talk to you in the meantime? [beat] Hello?

HAROLD
I’m... yes, sir.

BARTLET
Are you all right, Harold?

HAROLD
I hit my head on... I-I... I hit my head.

BARTLET
Are you bleeding?

HAROLD
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Can you put something on it?

HAROLD
Well, I need to get to the other... I-I can’t reach it and...

BARTLET
You go over and get it. I’ll stay right here.

A long pause.

BARTLET
Harold? [pause] Harold, are you back?

HAROLD
Yes, sir. I think the skipper should be here any minute, sir.

BARTLET
Can you tell us what’s going on?

HAROLD
Well...

BARTLET
Harold?

HAROLD
Hello?

BARTLET
We’re here.

HAROLD
Yeah.

BARTLET
Can you tell us what’s going on?

HAROLD
Well, we’re looking at I guess 80 foot seas with winds up to 120 knots. We’re shipping 
solid green water over the bow. And we’ve got a fire in the engine room. We lost our 
running lights and may get run over by an aircraft carrier that can’t see in the dark.

Bartlet is at a loss of what to say and kneels down.

BARTLET
Well, I don’t know, man. Sounds pretty bad, Harold. I think I’m going to ask for my 
money back. [pause] Harold?

HAROLD
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I’m going to stay right here, as long as the radio works, okay?

Abbey puts her hand on her husband’s shoulder.

HAROLD
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Hang on.

The conversation continues.

Original Airdate: November 10, 1999, 9:00 PM EST

Transcript By: Jo


West Wing S01E08
A crucial banking bill is at risk when political rivals of environmentally sensitive President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) attach a land-use rider to it that would allow strip-mining some of the Montana wilderness. C.J. (Allison Janney) tries to stamp out rumors that the Chief Executive chastised the Vice President (Tim Matheson) during a cabinet meeting. An overworked Leo (John Spencer) isn't too keen on his independent daughter, Mallory (Allison Smith), dating the handsome Sam (Rob Lowe). C.J. continues to fend-off the romantic charms of a perceptive reporter (Timothy Busfield) with a knack for sniffing out juicy stories. Former lovers Mandy (Moira Kelly) and Josh (Bradley Whitford) clash over the administration's attempt to jettison the land-use rider that might also ruin passage of the more important banking bill.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
1:30 A.M.
Bartlet, sitting in a chair in the middle of his office, is talking to Josh. 
Josh looks very sleepy, but Bartlet still continues to speak.

BARTLET
Yellowstone, established by an act signed by Ulysses S. Grant was the nation’s first 
national park - March 1, 1872.

JOSH
[stands] It’s getting late, sir. I was wondering, are we through for the evening?

BARTLET
[smiling] Well, we’re through with work, Josh, but this part’s fun.

JOSH
What part, sir?

BARTLET
The part where I get you to sit down, and teach you a little something.

JOSH
[sits] Ah.

BARTLET
Yeah.

JOSH
You’re not tired, sir?

BARTLET
No.

JOSH
Perhaps, if you get into bed and...

BARTLET
I’m a national park buff, Josh.

JOSH
I’m sorry, sir?

BARTLET
[smiling] I said I’m a national park buff. I bet you didn’t know that about me.

JOSH
Well, I didn’t know that about you, sir, but I’m certainly not surprised.

BARTLET
Why is that?

JOSH
You’re... quite a nerd, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Really?

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I assume that was said with all due respect.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[gets up and sits near Josh] Is it nerd-like to know that Everglades National Park 
is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States, 
AND has extensive mangrove forests?

JOSH
Just a little bit. Yes, sir.

BARTLET
There are 54 national parks in the country, Josh.

JOSH
Please tell me you haven’t been to all of them.

BARTLET
I HAVE been to all of them. I should show you my slide collection.

JOSH
Oh, would you?

BARTLET
[counting with fingers] Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Acadia, 
which is so often overlooked...

JOSH
You should certainly feel free to keep talking, but I need to go home so I could be back 
in my office in four hours.

BARTLET
Dry Tortugas...

JOSH
See, the thing is, I can’t leave without your permission.

BARTLET
Petrified Forests, North Cascades, Joshua Tree, Shenandoah National Park, right here 
in Virginia! [bangs hand on couch] We should organize a staff field trip to Shenandoah. 
What do you think? [walks to his desk and writes a note]

JOSH
Good a place as any to dump your body.

BARTLET
What was that?

JOSH
Did I say that out loud?

BARTLET
See, and I was gonna let you go home.

JOSH
But instead?

BARTLET
We’re gonna talk about Yosemite.

He sits back on his chair. Josh rests back his head on his chair.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
Leo is having breakfast with Mallory. They just finished drinking coffee when a waiter 
approaches.

WAITER
Thank you, Mr. McGarry.

LEO
Thanks, Tony. Hang on.

The waiter puts the bill on the table and stands beside them to wait for the payment. 
Leo picks up the bill and puts on his glasses.

MALLORY
Oh, let me pay for it.

LEO
Yeah, but this is my hotel.

MALLORY
Dad?

LEO
How much does a cup of coffee cost here, Tony?

TONY
Six dollars and 50 cents.

LEO
[to Mallory] You want to pay the check?

MALLORY
No.

LEO
[puts his credit card on the bill and gives it to the waiter] Thanks.

WAITER
Sure. [walks away]

MALLORY
Six dollars and 50 cents?

LEO
Yes... You haven’t told me about your mom.

MALLORY
Dad...

LEO
Tell me about her.

Congressman Matt Skinner approaches their table.

SKINNER
Leo!

LEO
Congressman Skinner!

SKINNER
Congratulations.

LEO
Thank you. You know my daughter, Mallory.

SKINNER
Of course. Hi, how are you?

MALLORY
Good to see you, Congressman.

SKINNER
Congrats again, Leo.

LEO
To all of us.

SKINNER
Right. [leaves their table]

MALLORY
The Banking Bill?

LEO
Yeah.

MALLORY
It’s gonna pass?

LEO
Yeah.

MALLORY
Congratulations.

LEO
Thank you. You haven’t told me about your mother.

MALLORY
What do you want to know?

LEO
Is she... [thinks] I don’t know. Tell me anything.

MALLORY
You could call her, and ask her how she’s doing, you know?

LEO
Yeah, or I could just ask you.

MALLORY
You could, but clearly, asking me wouldn’t do any good.

LEO
I’m beginning to get that impression. [takes something out of his jacket pocket]

MALLORY
What’s that?

LEO
Opera tickets. It’s our subscription night.

MALLORY
Mom doesn’t want them?

LEO
No.

MALLORY
Did you ask her?

LEO
Yes.

MALLORY
And while you were asking her if she wanted opera tickets you couldn’t just ask her 
how she’s doing?

LEO
I had an opportunity to give you up for adoption, you know.

MALLORY
Too late.

Leo starts to pack up and get ready for work.

LEO
Why couldn’t you say congratulations?

MALLORY
On the Banking Bill?

LEO
Yes.

MALLORY
I just did.

LEO
Please, Mallory. You were... I don’t know, you were smirking...

MALLORY
Dad...

LEO
...or rolling your eyes...

MALLORY
I was doing neither.

LEO
You were doing it with your voice.

MALLORY
Father... you’ve gone round the bend.

LEO
[looks at Mallory] You want the tickets?

MALLORY
Yes. [takes the tickets]

LEO
You want to walk me back to work?

MALLORY
Sure.

Leo looks at his daughter and smiles.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is talking to Mrs. Landingham.

C.J.
Till two in the morning?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes.

C.J.
They were talking till two in the morning?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I’d imagine the President was doing the lion’s share of the talking.

Behind C.J., the door to the Oval Office quickly opens as Bartlet comes out looking very happy.

BARTLET
We beat the Banking Lobby!

C.J.
It’s gonna pass?

BARTLET
We beat them.

C.J.
You’re confident?

BARTLET
Yep. It’s in the bag.

C.J.
Were you and Josh talking ‘til two in the morning about national parks?

BARTLET
Ooh, C.J., Everglades National Park is one of the biggest...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President... [points to the phone]

BARTLET
Right. I got to take this call so I can gloat about the Banking Bill.

C.J.
Enjoy yourself, sir.

BARTLET
Be talking about this C.J. This is the story!

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[starts to leave] Crunch them!

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[stops] Oh, incidentally, the California Live Oak is the...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Right.

C.J.
Have a good day, sir.

BARTLET
Twelfth round knockout, C.J.! []

C.J.
Yes, sir.

Bartlet steps into the Oval Office and closes the door. Mrs. Landingham smiles at C.J.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Vice President Hoynes steps into the Roosevelt Room full of cabinet officers.
He starts the cabinet meeting.

HOYNES
Good morning.

CABINET OFFICERS
Good morning.

HOYNES
[walks around the table to his seat] Let’s take our seats. The President is gonna be a 
couple minutes late. He wanted me to get things started. [sits] I should begin by welcoming 
all of you to our third cabinet meeting, our first in six months. And I know the President 
would want me to point out that this meetings are for us a unique opportunity to come 
together and exchange ideas and to discuss our goals for the future. Surely, our first goal 
has to be finding a way to work with Congress. We need to reach out to the House and to the...

The cabinet members swiftly stood up when they see Bartlet enter.

CABINET OFFICERS
Good morning, Mr. President.

HOYNES
Mr. President.

Bartlet looks around at his cabinet members and walks around the room.

BARTLET
This is the saddest looking cabinet I have ever... look at this. I have an agriculture 
secretary who hasn’t eaten a vegetable in his life. Everybody sit down. You’re freaking 
me out. Good morning, Leo.

LEO [OS]
Good morning, sir.

Bartlet walks to the woman at the end of the room.

BARTLET
Hello. Are you taking minutes?

WOMAN
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What’s your name?

WOMAN
Mildred, sir.

BARTLET
Mildred? I’m Josiah Bartlet. I’m the President of the United States. 

MILDRED
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What did I miss?

MILDRED
The Vice President. 
[reading from notes] “Let’s take our seats. The President’s gonna be a few minutes late...”

BARTLET
Uh, would you skip down, please?

MILDRED
Yes, sir. “I know the President would want me to point out that these meetings are unique 
opportunities for us to...” 

BARTLET
Actually, I find these meeting to be a fairly mind-numbing experience, but Leo assures 
me that they are Constitutionally required, so let’s get it over with. Proceed, Mildred.

MILDRED
“Surely, our first goal should be finding a way to work with Congress...”

BARTLET
Who said that?

MILDRED
The Vice President.

HOYNES
I did, sir.

BARTLET
Our first goal should be finding a way to work with Congress?

HOYNES
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You don’t think our first goal is should be finding a way to best serve the American People?

HOYNES
I didn’t say that Mr. President.

BARTLET
Really? Let’s have a look. [takes out his glasses and reads Mildred’s notes]
Yeah, that’s what it says right here. Would you like Mildred to read it back again?

HOYNES
No, thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Anything else?

MILDRED
No sir.

BARTLET
Good. Now let’s get to work.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Toby and Sam are going through a bunch of papers that they have written.

TOBY
It’s good.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
It’s good.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
It’s a little flat.

SAM
I think so, too.

TOBY
My writing’s been a little flat lately.

SAM
It’s not you. It’s me.

TOBY
Well, you did the best you could.

SAM
What do you mean?

TOBY
You reached your potential here.

SAM
No, I didn’t. I can do better than this.

TOBY
I can do better than this.

SAM
Are you saying I can’t do better than this?

TOBY
I’m saying you’re fine, and I’m flat.

JOSH
[passes by and stops] What’s going on?

TOBY
We’re having difficulty locating our talent.

JOSH
Are you hearing anything about the Banking Bill?

TOBY
What do you mean?

JOSH
I don’t know. I’m hearing some stuff.

TOBY
No, we’re fine.

JOSH
You sure?

TOBY
Yeah. I’m having lunch with Crane.

JOSH
When?

TOBY
Lunchtime.

JOSH
I shouldn’t be nervous?

TOBY
No.

JOSH
Okay. [leaves]

TOBY
Alright... It couldn’t have gone far, right?

SAM
No.

TOBY
Somewhere in this building... is our talent.

SAM
[looking at Toby] Yes.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
Danny visits C.J. in her office. C.J. is working on her computer.

DANNY
C.J.

C.J.
Danny. 

DANNY
How you doing?

C.J.
How is it my staff just lets you walk in here?

DANNY
They like me.

C.J.
They’re supposed to like me.

DANNY
Go figure.

C.J. walks out of his office and Danny follows her into the HALLWAY.

C.J.
What do you need?

DANNY
I heard the President roughed up Hoynes in the cabinet meeting.

C.J.
From who?

DANNY
“Whom.”

C.J.
Shut up. 

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
Where did you hear it?

DANNY
Got fifty cents?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Then you can read about it in my newspaper.

C.J. and Danny cut through the corner of the Communications Office.

DANNY
Hey, you want to have dinner with me tonight?

C.J.
No. Tell me more about this.

DANNY
Did it happen?

C.J
On the record?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Absolutely not.

DANNY
Off the record?

C.J.
What else is new?

DANNY
That’s what I thought. And you won’t have dinner with me.

C.J.
No.

DANNY
I’m a very good-looking guy, C.J. I mention that because that’s something people notice 
about me right away.

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
I like seafood. I like all food.

C.J.
Danny...

DANNY
I should also mention I ‘m a lively conversationalist. I’m very good at kayaking. 
I can kayak.

C.J.
I can’t, Danny.

DANNY
My point is, I can teach you.

C.J.
No, you idiot, I mean, I can’t have dinner.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. takes one last look at Danny as he leaves.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Reporters, including Danny, surround Hoynes in the hallway.

HOYNES
So, let me tell you something. Yesterday morning about ten o’clock, these two guys, 
as a joke, posted some false information on a website about this tiny start-up company, 
and it’s stock started shooting up. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the hoax had been uncovered 
and the stock had adjusted itself. But by the end of the day this company, which neither 
you or I or the Secretary of Commerce has ever heard of, closed out as the twelfth highest 
traded issue on the Nasdaq index. This just in: the Internet is not a fad.

REPORTER
Thank you, sir.

HOYNES
Hey, thank you all.

Hoynes starts to walk with his staff. Danny tries to ask him a question.

DANNY
Mr. Vice President...

HOYNES
How you doing, Danny?

DANNY
Fine, thank you sir.

HOYNES
What do you need?

DANNY
The cabinet meeting.

HOYNES
What about it?

DANNY
Anything you want to talk about?

HOYNES
Anything I want to talk about?

DANNY
Yes, sir.

HOYNES
Well, you know, now that you talk about it, I’ve been having this recurring dream about 
killing you.

DANNY
Sir...

HOYNES
What do you think that means?

DANNY
I heard some things about the meeting.

HOYNES
Hey, nothing happened.

DANNY
Sir...

HOYNES
Nothing happened.

DANNY
I heard different.

HOYNES
Well, you heard wrong.

DANNY
Okay.

HOYNES
[to staff] Let’s go.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. comes from behind Sam, who is walking to his office.

C.J.
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

C.J.
You heard anything about the cabinet meeting this morning?

SAM
Like what?

C.J.
Like the President took Hoynes out for a ride?

SAM
Someone’s talking?

C.J.
Yeah.

SAM
Who?

C.J.
I don’t know.

They walk inside the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Sam and C.J. see Mallory waiting in front 
of Sam’s office.

SAM
Hey.

C.J.
Hey, Mallory. [to Sam] Hey, let me know if you hear anything. [leaves]

SAM
Yeah.

MALLORY
Hi.

SAM
How you doing?

MALLORY
Pretty good. I just had breakfast with my father and I walked with him back.

SAM
Mm-hmm.

MALLORY
Can I talk to you for a second?

SAM
Sure.

Mallory walks into SAM’S OFFICE. Sam follows her.

SAM
So what’s up?

MALLORY
So.

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
Here’s the thing.

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
Do you by any chance like opera?

SAM
The opera?

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
You mean to go and watch and listen to?

MALLORY
Yes, Sam.

SAM
Why do you ask?

MALLORY
Because, as it happens, I have two tickets to the Beijing Opera this evening at the 
Kennedy Center. My father’s seats.

SAM
Beijing opera?

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
[smiling] You’re asking me out on a date.

MALLORY
No.

SAM
No?

MALLORY
No, I’m asking you if you’d like to go together with me to see an internationally 
renowned opera company perform a work indigenous to its culture. 

SAM
Right, and in what way will it distinguish itself from a date?

MALLORY
There will be, under no circumstances, sex for you at the end of the evening.

SAM
Okay.

MALLORY
So what do you say?

SAM
Well, uh... like most people, I’m an absolute nut for Chinese opera. The Chinese being 
known the world over for their soaring and romantic melodies, and what with your guarantee 
that there won’t be sex, I don’t see how I could say no.

MALLORY
Good, then. I’ll come by and get you in about 7:30.

SAM
Yeah.

Mallory heads for the door.

SAM
Hey, you know what’s good about this? If you hadn’t come along with your offer of Chinese 
opera and no sex, all I’d be doing later is watching Monday night football, so this works 
out great for me.

MALLORY
7:30.

SAM
Yes, indeed.

Mallory leaves. Sam smiles and walks to his desk.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY

Sam and C.J. are sitting on each of Leo’s chairs in front of his table. They are waiting 
for Leo to come. Margaret comes in and takes something from Leo’s file cabinet.

MARGARET
Leo will be in in a minute.

C.J.
Thanks.

SAM
Thank you.

Silence fills the room. C.J. asks Sam a question.

C.J.
What’s your thing about?

SAM
Nothing... What’s your thing about?

C.J.
Nothing.

SAM
Okay. 

LEO
[walks in] What do you need?

SAM
Oh, we’re not here together.

LEO
Somebody go first.

Sam and C.J. look at each other. C.J. decides to go first.

C.J.
Danny Concannon said that he heard that the President and Hoynes had a...

LEO
At the cabinet meeting?

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
It’s nothing, C.J.

C.J.
Then why is Danny asking me about it?

LEO
Who talked to him?

C.J.
You think he’s gonna tell me?
 
SAM
It was Hoynes.

LEO
That’s what we need.

C.J.
What do you want me to do?

LEO
Deal with it.

C.J.
You’re a real details man aren’t you, Leo?

LEO
Deal with it.

C.J. stands up and leaves the office. Leo sits down, rummaging through papers, and 
without looking at Sam...

LEO
What do you want?

SAM
I can come back another...

LEO
[not looking] No, come on, what?

SAM
Mallory had an extra ticket to the opera for tonight and she asked me if I’d like to go.

LEO
[still not looking] Mallory, who?

SAM
Mallory, your daughter.

LEO
[looks up swiftly and takes off his glasses] Mallory, my daughter... 

SAM
Yes.

LEO
...has asked you... 

SAM
Yes.

LEO
...to go to the opera using the tickets that used to belong to me and Mallory’s mother...

SAM
Yes.

LEO
...the woman who used to be my wife? 

SAM
Leo, for whatever it’s worth, she’s made it very clear we won’t be doing anything 
tonight you’d have a problem with.

LEO
Like what?

SAM
Why don’t we stay away from that?

LEO
Best that we do.

SAM
So...

LEO
I’m fine, Sam. 

SAM
You’re fine?

LEO
I’m fine.

SAM
You sure?

LEO
Jenny and I aren’t using them. Somebody should.

SAM
Thank you, Leo.

LEO
Go back to work, Sam.

SAM
Yeah.

Leo arranges the papers in his table. He pauses for a second and thinks.

LEO
I’m fine.

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - DAY
The room is flooded with camera flashes as Hoynes talks to a number of important people. 

HOYNES
Nitrogen and hydrogen, ladies and gentlemen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Now, Dick Brenner 
says we send a Saturn V rocket with a liquid-hydrogen payload or we can put a man on 
Mars for 25 billion dollars? That’s a steal at twice the price.

MAN
Once you’ve landed him, where are you gonna get the hydrogen to get him back?

HOYNES
Well, Mars is built made out of Nitrogen so the best thing to do is build ourselves a 
gas station.

CANDY
[approaches] Sir...

HOYNES
Yeah, we’re done here. Maybe we should take an earth science course again. Thank you, all.

CANDY
Sir, C.J. Cregg asked for a minute.

HOYNES
Yeah, I could have seen that coming.

Hoynes and his staff walk out of the Mural Room into the HALLWAY. C.J. tries to talk to him.

C.J.
Mr. Vice President...

HOYNES
Yeah, whoever Danny’s been talking to, it wasn’t me, C.J.

C.J.
I’d just want to keep it from becoming a story.

HOYNES
It’s not a story.

C.J.
And I’d like to keep it that way, sir.

HOYNES
What can I do for you?

C.J.
What happened at the cabinet meeting and how did Danny find out about it?

HOYNES
[stops walking] Nothing happened at the cabinet meeting and I have no idea how Danny 
found out about it. Moreover, the implication that I leaked privileged information is 
stupid as it is insulting. And I’d like to remind you, that whatever regard you may 
hold from me personally, you are addressing the office of the Vice President. 

C.J.
Yes, sir.

HOYNES
Anything else?

C.J.
No, sir.

HOYNES
Good. [to staff] Let’s go.

C.J. stands still as Hoynes walks away with his staff. 

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Toby knocks on the door of Sam’s open office. 

TOBY
Let’s go.

SAM
What’s up?

TOBY
Banking Bill’s gonna pass the house, let’s prepare a statement.

SAM
Crane’s sure?

TOBY
He said it was in the bag.

Toby and Sam step inside TOBY’S OFFICE. Josh follows them.

JOSH
How’s lunch?

TOBY
It’s in the bag.

JOSH
No, Toby, it’s not.

TOBY
I just got done with Crane.

JOSH
Well, Crane’s two hours behind.

TOBY
Oh, don’t tell me. 

SAM
What they attach?

JOSH
A land-use rider.

SAM
Who?

JOSH
Broderick and Eaton.

TOBY
Broderick and Eaton?

JOSH
Yep.

SAM
Don’t worry about it.

JOSH
Big Sky Federal Reserve, Sam. They want to strip mine the length and breadth of Montana.

SAM
We don’t care.

JOSH
We do care.

SAM
Not today.

JOSH
Sam...

SAM
Since when are you outdoorsy?

JOSH
Please, this isn’t about the environment. It’s about retribution.

TOBY
Yeah, no kidding.

There were a few moments of silence until they realized what they should do.

SAM
We need to see the President.

JOSH
Yeah, we need to see the President.

TOBY
Broderick and Eaton?

JOSH
Yep.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is having her usual briefing. Danny is sitting with other reporters.

C.J.
I am reluctant to characterize it other than to say the President is interested in what 
the practical effects of the policy would be.

REPORTER
But in all, you’d say the White House is optimistic about the chances of passage through 
the House of the Banking Bill?

C.J.
Very optimistic.

REPORTER
You’re not concerned about the attachment of the land use rider?

C.J.
I’m sorry?

REPORTER
I said The White House isn’t concerned about the attachment of the land-use rider?

C.J.
[slowly] That’s being worked out, and I can go into more detail later.

REPORTER
Any chance you could go into more detail now?

C.J.
I could, but then you’d have no reason to talk to me later.

REPORTER
C.J.?

C.J.
I’ll do that later this afternoon. Thank you everybody.

C.J. walks out of the briefing room, and steps to the HALLWAY. Danny follows her. 
Bonnie passes by.

C.J.
Bonnie, find Toby for me, would you?

BONNIE
Sure.

Danny surprises C.J. when he speaks from behind her.

DANNY
The land-use rider was a bit of shock for you, huh?

C.J.
Danny, do you see that this is a restricted area? There are signs posted.

DANNY
Where?

C.J.
There are usually signs posted.

They stop in front of many hardworking White House aides working hard in their bullpen.

DANNY
Hey you guys, you don’t mind me here do you?

AIDES
No.

DANNY
See.

C.J.
Danny... 

The two start to walk again.

DANNY
I’m saying it looked like someone took your legs behind you. Speaking of legs.
[looks at C.J.’s legs]

C.J.
First of all, you’re wrong. Second of all, shut up. Third, I went to Hoynes about your 
thing and it wasn’t him who talked to you and I believe him, and now he’s really pissed 
at me, and he’s right, and fourth... shut up again.

DANNY
It wasn’t Hoynes who talked to me.

C.J.
Yes, well, I know that now.

DANNY
I enjoy movies. I enjoy music. I’m not wild about ice-skating, but, what the hell, I’ll do it.

They stop again in front of the White House aides.

C.J.
Say goodbye to Danny, everybody.

AIDES
Bye Danny.

DANNY
[to C.J.] A day’s work for a day’s pay.

C.J. walks into the bullpen, where Bonnie is on the phone.

BONNIE
Toby’s in his office.

C.J.
Thanks. [starts to walk off]

BONNIE
Should I tell him you’re coming?

C.J.
No I’d like to keep it a surprise.

BONNIE
[to phone] Never mind, Cathy.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Bartlet and Leo walk. 

LEO
Big Sky Federal Reserve.

BARTLET
In Montana?

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What happened?

They step into LEO’S OFFICE.

LEO
Eaton and Broderick got a land-use rider to the conference report.

BARTLET
Eaton and Broderick?

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Eaton and Broderick attached a land-use rider?

They finally walk into THE OVAL OFFICE. Toby, Sam, Josh and other staffers are waiting.

LEO
You surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in strip-mining?

BARTLET
I’m surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in anything.

TOBY
It’s retaliatory, sir.

BARTLET
For what?

TOBY
The campaign.

BARTLET
What did I do to them during the campaign?

TOBY
You won, sir.

BARTLET
They want to strip-mine Big Sky?

SAM
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah.

SAM
Swallow it.

Behind Sam, Josh interrupts him.

JOSH
I knew you were gonna say that.

SAM
‘Cause it’s the right thing to do.

JOSH
No, it’s not.

SAM
You mean to tell me that... [faces Josh, and begins to argue]

BARTLET
Excuse me, fellas, over here please.

SAM
Mr. President, it’s a banking reform bill. That’s the ball game. Let’s not get into an 
intramural spitball contest over a couple of rocks that are inhabitable eight months of 
the year, anyway.

LEO
They’re pretty good looking rocks.

JOSH
What Sam meant to say was that we can live without the environmental lobby.

SAM
I don’t believe that is what I meant to say, Josh. What I mean to say is it’ll save real 
people real money.

JOSH
Tough.

BARTLET
What do you do, Josh?

JOSH
Veto it.

SAM
It’s our bill.

JOSH
Veto it anyway.

TOBY
He’s right.

LEO
Why?

TOBY
Send a signal to the banking committee that we will not be held hostage by Eaton and Broderick.

SAM
Yes, Mr. President. Tell them instead we’d much rather be held hostage by wildlife activists 
‘cause that’s a position that always works well for us, and I think it’s particularly important
in the next election that we carry Montana and its three electoral votes.

JOSH
I always knew the day would come when Sam would start selling off entire states. I was just 
hoping he’d start with Delaware.

BARTLET
Toby.

TOBY
Give me a few hours, sir. Let me talk to some people.

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I don’t like these people, Toby. I don’t want to lose.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
All right. What’s next?

Bartlet sits on the couch. The staffers gather round him.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Lying on his couch, Leo is reading from his clipboard. He doesn’t see Bartlet open the 
door from the Oval Office.

BARTLET
Hey.

LEO
Hey.

BARTLET
No, don’t get up.

LEO
[starts to get up] No, I’m just...

BARTLET
No, it’s fine. Please.

LEO
[standing] Did you need something?

BARTLET
Nah, I just came to see what you were doing.

LEO
No appointments?

BARTLET
Nah, you know, we had most of the night blocked for that thing, and it got cancelled so...

LEO
Take the night off.

BARTLET
Nah.

LEO
You should take the night off, sir.

BARTLET
[sits] Nah. I still got 400 pages of nonsense to read.

LEO
Leave it ‘til tomorrow.

BARTLET
I don’t like rattling around in that place with no one around but the butlers.

LEO
Call Abbey, get into bed, and turn on the football game.

BARTLET
Maybe later.

LEO
Okay.

Leo sits beside Bartlet. After a short silence, Bartlet asks his best friend a question.

BARTLET
You had breakfast with Mal?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
How’s she doing?

LEO
She pissed at me.

BARTLET
What did you expect?

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
You ignored her mother.

LEO
Oh, come on. I didn’t...

BARTLET
No, I’m saying that’s what it looks like to her right now.

LEO
But she sees what the job is.

BARTLET
She doesn’t see what the job is, Leo. And anyone would have to see it to believe it. 
And even if they saw it, even if they believed it, what would it matter? She’s her 
mother’s daughter, and you made her mother cry.

LEO
You really threw some sunshine down on that one. Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Well, I’m right next door all night.

LEO
Me too.

BARTLET
Okay.

He looks at Leo, and heads for his office.

Donna stands beside Josh’s office door. Mandy stands beside her. Josh is typing something 
in his computer and does not see Donna or Mandy.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Mandy wants to see you.

JOSH
Can you tell her I’m not in?

DONNA
No, I think the ship’s pretty much sailed on that one.

Josh swiftly looks at his door. He sees Donna and Mandy looking at him. Donna walks away 
and Mandy walks in.

JOSH
How you doing?

MANDY
Let me say this... it’s a good bill.

JOSH
The Banking Bill?

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
It is a good bill.

MANDY
What’s more, it works for us.

JOSH
Yes, it does.

MANDY
No more 24 percent card interest, more savings for the average people with a tax cut, 
no unjustified holds on deposits--these are all phrases I can do something with.

JOSH
I have no argument with that, but when they attach a rider that says they can strip-mine 
half a...

MANDY
You never climbed a tree in your life, Josh. You don’t give a damn about Big Sky.

JOSH
[stands] I don’t give a damn about Big Sky. I DO give a damn about hanging a sign outside 
the White House that says, “Hey Republicans and Congress, feel free to slap us around 
anytime you want just to show that you can.”

MANDY
You don’t like Broderick and Eaton.

JOSH
I don’t like Broderick and Eaton, but that’s not the point.

MANDY
I think it’s more the point than you think.

JOSH
How?

MANDY
When you’re competitive, when you’re combative, you juice up the President and you know it.

JOSH
Well, I’ll keep that in mind.

MANDY
No, you won’t.

JOSH
Why do you say that?

MANDY
Because you never do.

DONNA
[walks in] Josh?

JOSH
Yeah. [to Mandy] Got to go.

Josh leaves Mandy in his office. Mandy shouts when he walks away.

MANDY
I’m not done with you!

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
A White House staffer, LIZ, walks in Leo’s office and gives him a folder.

LEO
Oh, thanks, Liz.

Liz leaves as Charlie walks in from the other side.

CHARLIE
Excuse me, Mr. McGarry?

LEO
Charlie, call me “Leo” would you?

CHARLIE
I’ll try sir.

LEO
What do you need?

CHARLIE
I got a message from Nancy Becker’s office. Tomorrow’s the Deputy Transportation 
Secretary’s 50th birthday. They’re having a party, and the President usually likes to 
send a letter.

LEO
Yeah. Tell it to someone in the Communications Office. They’ll give it to one of the staffers.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Charlie starts to leave, but Leo stops him.

LEO
Wait. Nancy Becker needs it tonight?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

LEO
Give it to Sam.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Charlie walks in the hallway looking for Sam. From the other end of the hallway, Sam 
calls him. 

SAM
Charlie!

CHARLIE
Sam, listen...

SAM
How do I look?

CHARLIE
You look good.

SAM
I went to the gym, rode a bike, took a shower and shave...

CHARLIE
Mr. McGarry wants you to...

SAM
...Even got my shoes shined too, you know why?

CHARLIE
Sam?

SAM
I’m going to the Beijing Opera tonight, which I imagine would be excruciating, but I’m 
gonna go do it anyway.

CHARLIE
Tomorrow is the Assistant Transportation Secretary’s 50th birthday, and Leo wants you to 
write a message for the President.

SAM
[stops] He wants me?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

SAM
He wants me to write a birthday message for the President?

CHARLIE
Nancy Becker needs it tonight.

SAM
Are you sure he doesn’t want someone who, you know, isn’t staggeringly overqualified 
for the job?

CHARLIE
He specifically asked for you.

SAM
What time is it?

CHARLIE
[looks at watch] Ten after seven.

Sam enters the COMMUNICATION’S OFFICE. He talks to his aides, and Charlie follows him.

SAM
Um, somebody? Anybody? Um, write a two-page memo on the personal story and professional 
accomplishments of the assistant transportation secretary. 
[to Charlie] I got this under control.

While looking at Charlie, Sam walks in his office, but bumps himself on the wall beside 
his door. He looks at the door, at Charlie, and walks in his office successfully.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby is on his desk writing something. In front of him is Mandy, who tries to talk to him.

MANDY
Are you listening to me?

TOBY
Yes.

MANDY
What was the last thing I said?

TOBY
The last thing you said was, “Are you listening to me?”

MANDY
Toby!

TOBY
I’m not the one to talk to about the Banking Bill anymore, Mandy. I have hatred in my heart.

MANDY
Toward whom?

TOBY
You go ahead and pick them. Today, it’s Broderick and Eaton.

C.J.
[stands by Toby's door] Excuse me.

TOBY
Hey.

C.J.
What’s going on?

MANDY
Would you tell him that signing the bill, and then swallowing the bitter pill of 
strip-mining would not foreclose a P.R. approach that would trumpet banking reforms 
while at the same time, excoriating a special interest strip-mining a scam, which by 
the way, is what I’m happy to call it. Tell him that.

C.J.
Toby...

TOBY
Hmm?

C.J.
[slowly] Mandy wants you to recommend to the President that we do it her way.

TOBY
Do you understand what she said?

C.J.
No, but she seemed pretty confident.

MANDY
I would like to talk to Josh again.

TOBY
Talk to anyone you want, but in this particular room, I need to work.

MANDY
Thank you. [leaves]

C.J.
[follows] Mandy...

MANDY
You people are willing to cut your noses off to spite your faces.

C.J.
Mandy, I wanted to ask you something.

MANDY
What?

C.J.
You know Danny Concannon pretty well, don’t you?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
He’s sniffing around a story about the cabinet meeting this morning, which is not a 
big deal, but I want him to back off.

MANDY
Make him a trade.

C.J.
Yeah?

MANDY
Give him a half hour with the President.

C.J.
Thanks.

MANDY
Now, will you help me with Josh and Toby?

C.J.
The President’s been messed with. He beat the banking lobby, and Broderick and Eaton 
came back at the 11th hour and gave him a cheap clip in the knees. This is the kind of 
thing Josh and Toby get geared up for. You’re not gonna talk them down.

MANDY
You guys are idiots. Did you know that?

C.J.
In our own defense, we actually do know that.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam just finished writing the birthday message. Bartlet is going through it while Sam 
stands watch.

BARTLET
Well, this is fine.

SAM
Excellent.

BARTLET
They had you write this?

SAM
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You’re not a little overqualified for a birthday message?

SAM
I was happy to do it, sir.

BARTLET
Really?

SAM
Of course.

BARTLET
I appreciate it, Sam.

SAM
No problem.

BARTLET
[walks Sam to the door] Listen...

SAM
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I mean as long as you’re on it, and you don’t mind, why don’t we take advantage of your 
being on it and, you know, really do a job?

SAM
Do a job?

BARTLET
It’s his fiftieth birthday. Let’s give it the Sam Seaborn quill. What do you think?

SAM
Of course, I’d be honored to do it sir.

BARTLET
Good. Take your time. Bring me back the next draft when it’s ready. I really appreciate 
it, Sam.

SAM
My pleasure, Mr. President.

SAM walks out of the door to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Margaret is behind a desk and notices 
something.

MARGARET
Did you get your shoes signed, Sam?

SAM
Yes, I did.

Sam walks out to the HALLWAY. Behind him, Mallory, wearing a beautiful red dress and a 
jacket, calls him.

MALLORY
Hey, Sam!

SAM
Hello.

MALLORY
Are you ready to go?

SAM
I’d like to say first that you look beautiful tonight, Mallory.

MALLORY
Thank you, Sam.

SAM
I mean it.

MALLORY
What would you like to say second?

SAM
Can we talk in my office for a minute?

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
Danny is typing something in the press table. C.J. comes in from behind sits on a chair 
next to him. They don’t look at each other yet.

C.J.
Hello.

DANNY
[still typing] Hello.

C.J.
May I discuss your story for a moment?

DANNY
[stops typing and looks] Cabinet meeting?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Sure.

C.J.
‘Cause I really have a hard time believing that one of the cabinet officers...

DANNY
The cabinet officers weren’t the only people in the room.

C.J.
[realizes] I’m gonna fire her.

DANNY
Who?

C.J.
You know who.

DANNY
Don’t fire her.

C.J.
Why not?

DANNY
‘Cause it’s not nice.

C.J.
The President would appreciate it if you wouldn’t pursue this story, and to show his 
gratitude, he can give you thirty minutes on any subject or subjects that you like.

DANNY
Well, it sounds great, but it’s not enough.

C.J.
What else?

DANNY
I’d like you to sing a song for me.

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
A little song...

C.J.
Will you take it?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Thank you. [stands] 

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
Anybody gets fired over this, I’m gonna write about why.

C.J.
Understood.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam just told Mallory why he wasn’t ready to go.

MALLORY
The Assistant Secretary of Transportation?

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

SAM
Sure.

MALLORY
During the campaign, you crafted a significant portion of the President’s stump speech. 
Did you not?

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
The acceptance speech at the convention...

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
Inaugural...

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
State of the Union.

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
And now the President’s asking you to write a birthday card?

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
For the Secretary of Transportation?

SAM
Actually it’s the Assistant Secretary of Transportation.

MALLORY
Oh, the Assistant Secretary of Transportation.

SAM
Yes, one of them.

MALLORY
Sam, if you didn’t want to go with me you should have said so, and if you started to 
chicken out, you should have called me.

Mallory leaves, but Sam follows her out to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

SAM
I didn’t chicken out.

MALLORY
I’m all dressed up, Sam.

SAM
My shoes are shined.

MALLORY
Shut up.

They walk outside the HALLWAY.

SAM
This is something that came up, Mallory.

MALLORY
It’s his 50th birthday. They couldn’t have seen this coming for like the last fifty years?

SAM
Fair point.

MALLORY
I’m going home.

SAM
Don’t go home. Stay here. Give me a half hour and I’ll come up with a new draft.

MALLORY
[stops and looks] A new draft?

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
You’ve already done a draft?

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
You need to write more than one draft for a birthday card?

SAM
A birthday message, Mallory.

MALLORY
Sam...

SAM 
Half hour. We’ll get there by intermission. There’ll be plenty of death and shrieking 
in the second act.

MALLORY
Go.

SAM
You look fantas...

MALLORY
Go!

Sam goes to his office and Mallory sighs.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 

TOBY [VO]
We’re gonna want to look at a new draft by the end of the week. That’s all.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Toby just finished up a meeting with some people. He stays in his seat in the middle of 
the room writing something. Josh walks in.

JOSH
Toby?

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
You know what I think?

TOBY
What?

JOSH
I don’t think it was Broderick and Eaton. I just... I don’t think they have the muscle.

TOBY
[not looking] Yeah.

JOSH
I think it was Crane.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Honest to God, I think it was Crane.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Your friend, Crane.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
The guy who told you that it was gonna go through, no problem.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
You’re not bothered by this?

TOBY
I wouldn’t say that. I’d say we’ve reached the end of the line, and I’m really not 
interested in how we got there, and I’m ready to move on.

JOSH
How?

TOBY
Sam’s right.

JOSH
No.

TOBY
Let’s tell him to sign it.

JOSH
Not yet.

TOBY
Round’s over, Josh. We did fine. [packs his things and starts to leave]

JOSH
We got screwed, Toby.

TOBY
Not so bad.

JOSH
Yeah, but Crane and Broderick and Eaton?

TOBY
It was their turn.

JOSH
I’m still working on this.

TOBY
The President’s gonna need to hear something.

JOSH
I got a few hours.

TOBY
Suit yourself.

Toby leaves Josh in the Roosevelt Room.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
C.J. heads for the Oval Office. Mrs. Landingham greets her.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good evening, C.J.

C.J.
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham. Is he free for a moment?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
He’s catching up on some reading.

C.J.
I can come back.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Go on in. I think he’s looking for company.

C.J.
Thanks.

C.J. opens the door to THE OVAL OFFICE. She sees Bartlet reading a stack of papers.

BARTLET
Hey, C.J.

C.J.
Good evening, Mr. President. Am I disturbing you?

BARTLET
No, sit down.

C.J.
What’s going on?

BARTLET
When are Josh and Toby gonna come up with a solution, huh?

C.J.
For the land-use rider?

BARTLET
I want the banking bill, and I don’t want to give in.

C.J.
The classic conundrum.

BARTLET
Yeah.

C.J.
Speaking of classic conundrums...

BARTLET
I don’t want to hear about Hoynes and the cabinet meeting.

C.J.
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Is Danny gonna make it a thing?

C.J.
No.

BARTLET
What did you have to give him?

C.J.
A half hour sit-down on the record.

BARTLET
[pause] Sold.

C.J.
Sir, the Vice President wasn’t the one who talked.

BARTLET
Sure he was.

C.J.
No, sir.

BARTLET
You’re wrong.

C.J.
I’m pretty sure it was the woman taking minutes.

BARTLET
Mildred?

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
Let’s drop it.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Anything else?

C.J.
No, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Get out of here.

C.J.
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam, seated in his chair, is thinking of something to write for a new draft of the 
birthday message.

SAM
Okay... [sighs] Okay, here we go...

MALLORY
Would you come on!

Mallory is behind him, waiting impatiently.

SAM
What are you Ralph Kramden?

MALLORY
Sam...

SAM
Like I’m not under enough pressure?

MALLORY
It’s a birthday card.

SAM
I don’t care if it’s a cupcake recipe, Mallory. I was asked to do it by the President 
of the United States!

MALLORY
What did you say?

SAM
I said I was asked to do it by the President of The United States!

MALLORY
No, you weren’t. Sam, did you, by any chance, tell my father that you and I were going 
out tonight?

SAM
Yes, I did.

MALLORY
Excuse me. [leaves]

SAM
[still tries to write something] Okay, here we go. [beat] Nope!

He throws his yellow pad in his desk.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is on his couch talking to Margaret, who is writing what Leo is saying.

LEO
Findings, which by the way, did nothing to support our positions in light of the finance 
committee’s speculation need to be referred back to the O.M.B. Yours very unhappily...

MARGARET
Okay.

LEO
Copy that to Josh.

MARGARET
What’s the President gonna do about Big Sky?

LEO
When he tells me, I’ll tell you. What’s next?

Margaret puts down her pad and picks another one. Mallory walks in.

MALLORY
Excuse me, Margaret. [to Leo] Hello.

LEO
Hey, baby.

MALLORY
Don’t “hey baby” me, you addle-minded Machiavellian jerk!

MARGARET
Should I step out?

LEO
Sounds like it.

Margaret leaves. Leo stands and heads for his desk.

MALLORY
You gave him that idiot assignment on purpose!

LEO
Yes.

MALLORY
Why?

LEO
‘Cause, I felt like it.

MALLORY
Dad...

LEO
You know what, Mal? Your mom’s got a genuine beef. I widowed her the day I took over the 
campaign, but I don’t think I’ve done anything to you. Working on the White House doesn’t 
allow any flexibility in so far as leisure time as you’ve discovered this evening. I’m 
done being blamed by you for this.

MALLORY
So you made Sam write a birthday card?

LEO
A birthday message.

MALLORY
Why?

LEO
Just my sense of humor.

From the Oval Office, Bartlet comes in and heads for the door on the other side, to call 
on Margaret.

BARTLET
Hey, Mal.

MALLORY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Margaret! [looks at Mallory] Hey, you’re all dressed up.

MALLORY
Yes, I am.

MARGARET
[walks in] Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Yes, uh, could you bring me the chief of staff’s schedule for today, please?

MARGARET
Yes, sir. [leaves]

BARTLET
Thank you. [looks at Mallory] You look a little glum, Mallory. Did you have plans to go 
out this evening with someone who had to cancel due to circumstances beyond their control 
because they have made a commitment to a common and higher purpose?

MALLORY
[points at the President] You’re a coconspirator on this!

Margaret comes in with a clipboard. She gives it to Bartlet and leaves.

BARTLET
Oh, thank you Margaret. [to Mallory] These are some of the things your father did today. 
[reading] He met with the director of the C.I.A., and received an intelligence briefing 
regarding stores of plutonium in a country which, shall we just say is not on our Christmas 
card list. He brokered a compromise among democrats for funding of something fairly trivial, 
but I can’t remember quite what it was, oh yes, the U.S. Army, yes. He met with chief counsel 
to discuss the news hat it’s possible I’ve broken some federal laws in the week and may have 
to serve from one to three years in prison after resigning my office in disgrace.
[to Leo] How’d that go by the way?

LEO
We’re fine.

BARTLET
Cool. He received a security briefing, a Central American briefing, and wrote a position 
paper, and he’s been counseling me throughout the day of a bad decision I have to make. 
Oh, and by the way, this was a very light day.

MALLORY
Due respect, Mr. President... what’s your point?

BARTLET
Uh... that’s a perfectly fair question.

LEO
You know what, sir? I can take it from here.

BARTLET
Okay.

LEO
Thank you.

BARTLET
I’m right next-door.

LEO
Thank you.

BARTLET
[heads for his office, but stops] Oh, my point is... give your dad a break. He’s your father.

MALLORY
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Are you blowing me off?

MALLORY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

When the President is gone, Mallory looks at her father.

MALLORY
I’m not blaming you, Dad.

LEO
It feels like you are.

MALLORY
Let me fix that.

LEO
Okay.

MALLORY
Let’s say you and I, we take this tickets. We’ll go catch the second act? 
[takes her father's jacket]

LEO
Is there a way, any other way, we can fix this?

MALLORY
Dad...

LEO
Did you hear the President tell you about my day?

MALLORY
Yes.

LEO
And now, Chinese Opera?

MALLORY
Okay, coffee and dessert.

LEO
Now you’re talking!

MALLORY
We should ask Sam.

LEO
[puts on jacket] Yes, by all means, let’s ask Sam.

MALLORY
Be nice to him.

LEO
I’ll me gone for a while, Margaret!

MARGARET [OS]
Okay.

MALLORY
Dad...

LEO
I’ll be nice! I’ll be nice. Leave me alone!

They head out.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
In his office, Sam writes something in his pad. He immediately tears it off and crumples it. 
He bangs his hand three times on his desk, and throws the paper away. He tries to write again.

SAM
This is getting serious.

Mallory knocks on Sam’s door. Leo is behind her.

MALLORY
Good news.

SAM
Hello.

LEO
Hello, Sam.

MALLORY
You’re off the hook for opera. We would like you to come and join us for coffee. 
Also, my father has something he’d like to say to you.

LEO
Wha, is this really necessary?

MALLORY
I believe it is.

LEO
Sam, I gave you the thing to do ‘cause I was pissed you were taking, you know, 
blah, blah, blah.

MALLORY
Well said, Dad.

LEO
Anyway, I’m sorry about that.

SAM
I figured. Say, you mind if I skip the coffee? I want to nail this thing.

LEO
Forget it, Sam. Your first draft was fine.

SAM
Yeah, but I want to nail it, Leo.

MALLORY
Sam, the President was in on it. Your first draft is fine.

SAM
Yeah, but still...

MALLORY
You want to nail it.

SAM
I do.

MALLORY
You’re so exactly like him. [looks at Leo]

SAM
Well, that is the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me. Thank you.

MALLORY
[to Leo] Let’s go.

LEO
[to Sam] I’ll be back in an hour.

Leo and Mallory leave. 

SAM
Alright... Here we go...

Sam smiles as he writes something in his pad again.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Nancy knocks and opens the door. Bartlet is sitting in his chair with his feet on the 
desk, reading something. We can see that Hoynes is waiting behind Nancy.

NANCY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Yes?

NANCY
The Vice President, sir.

BARTLET
[beat] Yeah, okay.

Hoynes walks in. Bartlet stands up.

HOYNES
Good evening, sir.

BARTLET
How are you, John?

HOYNES
Fine sir.

BARTLET
Good. What can I do for you?

HOYNES
I thought we ought to straighten out this business from this morning before it got out 
of hand.

BARTLET
C.J. already talked to Danny Concannon. I think we’re fine.

HOYNES
Actually, I mean, between us.

BARTLET
Well, that’s a different story.

HOYNES
I was not Concannon’s source. You can believe that or not, but it is true.

BARTLET
Okay.

HOYNES
Well, good night, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good night, John.

Hoynes heads for the door. 

BARTLET
John?

HOYNES
What did I ever do to you? Where, in our past, what did I do to make you treat me this way?

BARTLET
John...

HOYNES
What did I ever do to you except deliver the South?

BARTLET
Really?

HOYNES
Yes.

BARTLET
You shouldn’t have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President.

HOYNES
Due respect, Mr. President, you have just kicked my ass in a primary. I’m fifteen years 
younger than you. I have my career to think of.

BARTLET
Then don’t stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate. 
You shouldn’t have made me beg.

A brief silence fills the room.

HOYNES
I’m glad C.J. straightened things out with Danny.

BARTLET
Yeah.

HOYNES
Good night, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good night, John. [looks at Hoynes as he leaves]

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh rummages through the papers in his desk looking for something. Mandy is behind him.

MANDY
This bill will stop the banking lobby from getting whatever it wants, including total bank 
deregulation.

Josh heads for Donna’s desk. MANDY follows him.

JOSH
Donna, who am I talking to about this?

DONNA
Madison.

JOSH
Thank you. [heads back to his office]

MANDY
You don’t think it’s worth giving up a piece of land?

JOSH
Mandy...

MANDY
I’m saying there’s a political gain to beating the banking lobby.

JOSH
There’s a political cost of letting it go with the rider attached.

MANDY
I know you want to win, Josh, but I’ve got news for you: you’ve won.

JOSH
No, we’re tied.

MANDY
And when that’s the best you can do, you depart the field and you call it a win.

JOSH
[walks to Donna’s desk] It’s not a win. Donna, will you tell Leo’s office that I’ll have 
a solution for the President, very soon.

DONNA
Do you have a solution for the President?

JOSH
Does it look like I have a solution for the President?

DONNA
No.

JOSH
[walks back to his office] Then let’s assume that I don’t.

MANDY
I can put a best face on it, Josh. It’s what I do.

JOSH
You can put a best face on a turnpike collision, Mandy. I’m not moved.

Mandy slams Josh’s door and stands in Josh’s way. Josh, surprised, looks at Mandy.

MANDY
You’re fighting the wrong fights, and you’re doing it for the wrong reasons. That’s all.

Mandy opens the door and leaves. Donna walks in the office.

DONNA
What was that about?

JOSH
[sits in his chair] Nothing.

DONNA
You sure?

JOSH
Okay. Where’s the Madison stuff?

DONNA
We’re getting it.

JOSH
Donna, it’s twenty minutes. I need it faster.

DONNA
We’re working, Josh, but honestly, the computer files are pretty antiquated.

JOSH
Yeah, you’re right. [beat] Wait, what?

DONNA
I said that the computer...

JOSH
They’re antiquated.

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
[sing-song] They’re antiquated.

DONNA
What’s wrong with you?

JOSH
Would you have them tell the President that I’m ready to see him in his convenience?

DONNA
You sure?

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam is typing up the birthday message in his computer. Toby is behind him, looking at 
the screen.

TOBY
Hmmm... Hmm... Hmmm...

SAM
[stops typing] You know, I got to tell you, Toby?

TOBY
Am I bothering you?

SAM
Well, I’m not feeling relaxed.

TOBY
Well, maybe you need a glass of wine.

SAM
Maybe you need to stop standing over my shoulder.

TOBY
Why don’t you let me try this?

SAM
I’m gonna nail it this time!

JOSH
[stands at the door] Guess what?

TOBY
[to Josh] Tell him to let me write this thing, will you?

JOSH
The antiquities act.

TOBY
The antiquities act?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
That’s creative.

SAM
The antiquities act!

TOBY
The President is empowered to designate any federal land to be a national park.

SAM
Big Sky.

JOSH
It’s a done deal.

TOBY
Go tell him.

JOSH
You want to come?

TOBY
No, I want to stay here.

JOSH
What are you doing?

TOBY
I want to nail this.

JOSH
What is that?

TOBY
It’s a birthday card for someone.

JOSH
For who?

TOBY
I don’t know.

SAM
It’s a birthday message.

TOBY
Let me try a crack at this.

SAM
One more try!

JOSH
You two need to put your heads down on your desk you know that?

Josh leaves, and Sam continues typing.

TOBY
Right away you’re starting off bad.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is talking to Charlie, who is standing behind the couch.

BARTLET
Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie. And hikers are told to talk 
or sing along the trail to keep them at bay.

CHARLIE
If I see a grizzly bear, I’m supposed to sing to it, sir?

BARTLET
It’s not as silly as it sounds.

CHARLIE
Well, it sounds pretty silly.

BARTLET
I suppose.

CHARLIE
Was there anything else?

BARTLET
Yes, Glacier Park was the tenth. We have 44 to go.

JOSH
45. [walks in]

CHARLIE
I quit.

JOSH
I hear ya.

BARTLET
Have a good night, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Good night, Mr. President. [gives the President’s jacket to Josh and leaves]

BARTLET
[to Josh] What have you got?

JOSH
The antiquities act. You’re gonna establish Big Sky National Park.

Bartlet laughs at the idea.

JOSH
Yeah.

BARTLET
I can do this?

JOSH
Yeah.

BARTLET
You understand it’s a bunch of rocks, right?

JOSH
I’m sure someone with your encyclopedic knowledge of the ridiculous and dork-like will 
be able to find a tree or a ferret that the public has a right to visit.

BARTLET
[stands] More than a right, Josh.

JOSH
Sir.

BARTLET
It’s a treat.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You would enjoy nature.

JOSH
I’ve tried nature, sir. [helps Bartlet with his jacket]

BARTLET
The antiquities act!

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
This is simplicity itself.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Good job.

JOSH
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

JOSH
Good night, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good night.

He takes his bag and heads out. A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him.

BARTLET
[to agent] Thank you. Good night.

Bartlet walks out to the PORTICO. Josh tries to run and catch up with him.

JOSH
Mr. President?

BARTLET
[looks back] Yeah?

JOSH
We talk about enemies more than we used to.

BARTLET
What?

JOSH
We talk about enemies more than we used to... I wanted to mention that.

BARTLET
Yeah.

JOSH
Good night, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good night.

Bartlet heads for the residence. A secret service agent whispers to the wireless mike 
on his wrist.

West Wing S01E09
When a Supreme Court Justice Crouch (Mason Adams) retires, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) has a golden opportunity to impact the court's composition by nominating Judge Peyton Cabot Harrison III; but when further study reveals the candidate's conflicting ideology, the President might opt for Judge Roberto Mendoza (Edward James Olmos). In addition, a headline seeking congressman, Peter Lillienfield (Holmes Osborne) on the House Government Oversight Committee accuses the White House staff of substance abuse -- a dicey issue for one important member, Leo McGarry (John Spencer).

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
MONDAY MORNING
There is a continuous banging from somewhere. Josh and C.J. are both on the phone in 
his office. Josh is doing the talking. C.J. is listening through another phone line.

JOSH
[into phone] Yes... Yes... Yes... So are you prepared at this point to...

Josh and C.J. suddenly jump as if they won something. 

JOSH
[into phone] Thank you. Thank you, sir. Uh, if you’ll sit by the phone for a few minutes, 
you can expect a call from the president. Thank you again. [hangs up the phone slowly] 

C.J.
YES! 

JOSH
It’s done.

C.J.
We did it!

JOSH
It is done!

C.J. goes running screaming into JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA. Josh follows quickly. Donna is 
outside. Everyone looks at them.

C.J.
It’s done!

DONNA
Who did it?

C.J.
We did it!

JOSH
I did it! C.J. was on the phone with her fingers crossed.

C.J.
All you did was just one phone call.

JOSH
It was a series of phone calls, which I masterminded, while I’m not one to be selfish 
about credit, I think it is important to know that it is done, and I DID IT! Donna, call 
Toby. Call Sam. Call Leo. Call the president. Tell them I’m on my way over. 

C.J.
Congratulations!

JOSH
Nothing to the press.

C.J.
Yes. [starts to walk away]

JOSH
Claudia Jean?

C.J.
Yeah?

JOSH
We did it!

C.J.
Yeah!

They hug tight. C.J. walks off as Josh walks the other way. Donna quickly catches up 
into the NORTHWEST LOBBY.

DONNA
Wait!

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Don’t you want to know about the banging in your office?

JOSH
Banging in my office?

DONNA
They’ve been at it all morning.

JOSH
Banging?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

They cut into the HALLWAY.

DONNA
Josh, there’s a loud banging or thumping coming from the floor above your office.

JOSH
I didn’t notice.

DONNA
How could you not notice?

JOSH
Because I didn’t, Donna. I’ve been on the phone for the last hour trying to seal the deal 
to fill a seat on the Supreme Court.

DONNA
It was a pretty loud banging, Josh.

JOSH
You got to understand I’m talking about the United States Supreme Court right?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Okay.

Josh and Donna pass the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Sam comes out and gives Josh a high five. 
Toby comes out from an office and also gives Josh a high five.

SAM
Who da man?

TOBY
You da man!

SAM and JOSH
We da man!

DONNA
This is just gross.

JOSH
Wait there for me.

Josh, Sam and Toby walk inside the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Mrs. Landingham is behind her desk. 
Toby laughs.

TOBY
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning.

JOSH
Good morning!

SAM
Good morning, indeed.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Josh?

JOSH
Yes, Mrs. Landingham?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Is it done?

JOSH
Well, that depends on your answer to this question, Mrs. Landingham: Who da man?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Excuse me, Josh?

Toby is still laughing.

JOSH
Hmmm... Who da man?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You da man.

JOSH and SAM
[bumps chests] We da man!

TOBY
You da men.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
He’s waiting for you.

JOSH
Thank you.

Toby sighs. They walk in THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet and Leo are inside.

BARTLET
I heard we may have...

JOSH
Yes sir.

BARTLET
I can call him?

JOSH
He’s waiting for you sir.

BARTLET
It’s done?

JOSH
Done.

LEO
You got yourself a Supreme Court nominee, Mr. President.

BARTLET
This is huge. Which one of you is the man?

TOBY
On this one, we’d like to think of ourselves collectively as the men, sir.

BARTLET
Mrs. Landingham, let’s make the phone call!

JOSH
Congratulations.

BARTLET
Thank you. You too. [They shake hands.]

SAM
Well done, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Leo, Toby, Sam and Josh go into LEO’S OFFICE. Mandy is already inside.

MANDY
You guys rock.

SAM
Oh, we really do.

LEO
Let’s bring in the chairman and the ranking member from judiciary, the leadership from 
both sides, and C.J. you should...where is C.J.?

C.J.
[comes in behind Leo] Right here. 

LEO
[turns around] Oh.

C.J.
Sorry.

LEO
You should wear a bell around your neck, you know that?

C.J.
Thank you.

LEO
So what do we want to we do?

TOBY
C.J. will let the press know that the president will introduce his nominee in an east room 
press ceremony Thursday, 5 p.m.

JOSH
Can we do it on Friday, and give ourselves more time?

TOBY
Thursday.

JOSH
Why?

SAM
Because that’s when people watch T.V.

MANDY
We can do this in four days?

TOBY
Yep.

LEO
Are you sure?

TOBY
Yep.

LEO
Toby, you’re running the show.

TOBY
I know.

LEO
Put the ball in the hole.

TOBY
It’s done.

LEO
No, it’s not. So get it done.

TOBY
Yes sir. 

Toby comes out of Leo’s office into the HALLWAY. Josh, Sam, Mandy and C.J. follow.

TOBY
Josh, get me everything.

JOSH
We vetted him two months.

TOBY
I’m gonna vet him four more days. I want to know every parking ticket. I want to know 
every girlfriend he stood up for dinner in 1953. Mandy, you’re gonna roll this guy out 
on a show that makes the queen’s coronation look like dinner theater. Sam, you’re gonna 
write the president’s introduction. You’re also gonna write the Harrison’s remarks.

SAM
Harrison’s not gonna like that.

TOBY
Show him the robe he gets. He’ll like it fine. 

They all walk inside the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

TOBY
C.J., no leaks. If the name of this nominee is leaked out before I want it to be leaked 
out, I’m gonna blame you, and you’re gonna find that unpleasant.

C.J.
I got to tell you something, Toby. You’re hot when you’re like this.

TOBY
[yells] I am gonna put Harrison on the Court! I swear to God I am!

JOSH
We meet again three hours.

MANDY
C.J., come talk to me.

Toby goes inside his office. Mandy and C.J. walk off.

SAM
Did you see his face?

JOSH
We’re home.

SAM
I’ll see you later.

Sam goes inside his office. Donna quickly appears in front of Josh. 

DONNA
It’s a maintenance crew.

JOSH
The banging?

DONNA
They’re working upstairs.

They walk out into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Peyton Cabot Harrison III.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Peyton Cabot Harrison III. He sounds like he should be a Supreme Court justice.

DONNA
It’s a good name.

JOSH
Phillips Exeter, Princeton, Rhodes scholar, Harvard Law Review, for which he was, oh yeah, 
the editor. Did I mention that he was dean of Harvard Law School? Did I mention that his 
father was attorney general to Eisenhower?

DONNA
Peyton Cabot Harrison III. 

JOSH
That’s right.

DONNA
Jewish fellow?

JOSH
You’re not gonna ruin this moment for me, Donna.

DONNA
I’m sharing this moment with you.

JOSH
This is a big day for us.

DONNA
You’re the men.

The two go inside JOSH’S OFFICE. Josh sits in his chair. Donna sits across him. 
The banging still continues.

JOSH
You know what we’re finally gonna have?

DONNA
A waspy old man in the Supreme Court?

JOSH
A smooth confirmation process.

DONNA
You think?

JOSH
It’s gonna sail.

DONNA
I hope so.

JOSH
It’s gonna sail, Donna.

DONNA
There’s many a slip twixt the tongue and the wrist, Josh.

JOSH
Yes. Well, your fortune cookie wisdom notwithstanding, it’s gonna sail.

DONNA
Please don’t get your hopes up.

JOSH
Why shouldn’t I get my hopes up?

DONNA
Because when it doesn’t work out, you end up drunk in my apartment in the middle of 
the night and yell at my roommate’s cats.

JOSH
Smooth sailing, Donna.

DONNA
Cautious optimism, Josh.

JOSH
Nothing bad is gonna happen this week.

DONNA
Exercise cautious optimism.

JOSH
Look, there is no reason...

A big chunk of the ceiling comes falling down in front of Josh. It crashes on his desk.

JOSH
Well... okay.

He dusts his sleeve and looks up the ceiling.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE SUPREME COURT - JUSTICE CROUCH’S OFFICE - DAY

The retiring Supreme Court Justice JOSEPH CROUCH is with President Bartlet.

BARTLET
You’re too young to retire, Joseph.

CROUCH
[laughs] You’re an excellent liar, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[chuckling] Yes sir.

CROUCH
You’re gonna go with Harrison?

BARTLET
He’s on the short list.

CROUCH
Yeah?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CROUCH
With how many other names?

BARTLET
We’ll make our announcement on Thursday.

CROUCH
You’ve decided on Harrison.

BARTLET
I haven’t made a decision yet, Joseph.

CROUCH
You’ve made the call. [beat] Did you even consider Mendoza?

BARTLET
Mendoza was on the short list.

CROUCH
Mendoza was on the short list so you can show you had an Hispanic on the short list.

BARTLET
That’s not true, Joseph.

CROUCH
You ran great guns in the campaign. It was an insurgency, boy, a sight to see. And then 
you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath. Just the middle 
of the road. Nothing but a long line painted yellow.

BARTLET
Excuse me, sir...

CROUCH
I wanted to retire five years ago. But I waited for a Democrat. I wanted a Democrat. 
Hmm! And instead I got you.

CUT TO: EXT. THE SUPREME COURT - DAY
The press is waiting below the stairs of the Supreme Court. Danny is among them. 
C.J. approaches.

DANNY
Hey.

C.J.
Hey.

DANNY
How you doing?

C.J.
I’m doing fine, Danny.

DANNY
Is it gonna be Harrison?

C.J.
Why, why, oh why do you ask me questions that you absolutely, positively know I’m not 
gonna answer?

DANNY
It’s a good conversation starter.

C.J.
I can’t go out on a date with you, Danny.

DANNY
Who asked you?

C.J.
Okay.

DANNY
You think Harrison is gonna be a good Justice?

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
You see what I did there?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
I tried to trick you into confirming it was Harrison.

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
It didn’t work.

C.J.
No.

DANNY
And you won’t go out on a date with me, right?

C.J.
Right.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. walks behind the podium and grabs a bunch of papers. She takes a look at Danny and 
walks away.

CUT TO: INT. JUSTICE CROUCH’S OFFICE - DAY
Justice Crouch and President Bartlet are still talking.

BARTLET
I suppose we should get out there.

CROUCH
Not yet, sir.

BARTLET
I’m sorry Joseph, but I am...

CROUCH
I’ve served on this bench for 38 years. I took my seat the year you began college. 
I believe I’ve earned the right to say a word.

BARTLET
You’ve said quite a few words.

CROUCH
Not enough.

BARTLET
Let’s get out there.

CROUCH
Take the next few days with your staff, and give Mendoza the consideration he deserves.

BARTLET
Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you...

CROUCH
When the next seat opens up, you’ll be writing your memoirs.

BARTLET
In three years, I would hope to be running for reel...

CROUCH
You’re gonna get beat in three years.

BARTLET
That’s a little pessimistic, Joseph.

CROUCH
American voters like guts. And Republicans have got them. In the three years, one of them 
is gonna beat you.

BARTLET
You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very 
different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate: 
an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media.

CROUCH
So did Harry Truman.

BARTLET
Well, I am not Harry Truman.

CROUCH
Mr. Bartlet, you needn’t point out that fact.

BARTLET
[beat] It’s “Dr. Bartlet,” your honor. Now, let’s go start your retirement.

CUT TO: EXT. THE SUPREME COURT - DAY
C.J. is pacing back and forth. Danny is with her.

DANNY
Want my gloves?

C.J.
No, thanks.

DANNY
I asked because you look pretty cold.

C.J.
I’m fine.

DANNY
What do you suppose they’re talking about in there?

C.J.
The president and Justice Crouch are old friends.

DANNY
The president and Justice Crouch can’t stand each other.

C.J.
The man’s retiring today. It’s a courtesy call. What do you want from me?

DANNY
Dinner and a movie.

C.J.
No.

DANNY
You think Crouch is pissed because the president has already settled on Harrison?

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
I did it again!

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
But you know what you did?

C.J.
What?

DANNY
You outfoxed me.

C.J.
You’re killing me. You know that, Danny. 

A woman, coming down from the stairs, passes by.

WOMAN
Here we go.

We see Bartlet, Crouch and several Secret Service Agents coming down the front stairs 
of the Supreme Court. C.J. approaches them. Danny goes back to the press area.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
A maintenance guy is working on the ceiling. Josh and Donna stand watch.

JOSH
That was inches from my head.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Inches.

DONNA
It was not inches.

JOSH
It was inches. A little bit this way, a little bit that way, bam! Massive head wound.

DONNA
You’re fine.

JOSH
Yeah, but there for the grace of God, you know what I’m saying?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I really think if big chunks of ceiling are gonna fall on anyone... I don’t know...

A brief silence as Josh inhales.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
It should be you.

DONNA
Ugh. I knew you were gonna say that.

JOSH
From now on, before I come in in the morning, I want you to test my office.

MANDY
[comes up] Josh?

DONNA
Staff in ten minutes. [leaves]

JOSH
You see this?

MANDY
Yeah.

JOSH
Inches from my head.

MANDY
Why is Peter Lillienfield holding a press conference?

JOSH
Who cares?

MANDY
I do. Why is Lillienfield holding a press conference?

JOSH
I don’t know.

MANDY
Is he unhappy about something?

JOSH
He’s always unhappy about something. [calls] Donna! Where’s my east Asia memo?!

DONNA [OS]
[yells] Right here!

MANDY
It starts in two minutes.

JOSH
What starts in two minutes?

MANDY
Lillienfield’s press conference.

JOSH
[shouts] It’s okay, Donna. I’ll just come and get it myself!

DONNA [OS]
Keep your pants on Josh! I’m on my way!

MANDY
Josh?

JOSH
Mandy.

MANDY
I’m just saying that we don’t need any surprises today.

JOSH
We’re not gonna have any surprises today.

MANDY
I’m putting on a show. I don’t want to get upstaged.

JOSH
You’re not gonna get upstaged.

Mandy leaves. Donna comes in hurriedly with a piece of paper. She gives it to Josh.

DONNA
Here.

JOSH
Thank you.

DONNA
You’re welcome.

JOSH
You should be nice to me. I could be dead you know.

DONNA
I don’t have that kind of luck. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Toby is behind his desk writing. Sam comes in.

SAM
Yeah?

TOBY
I would like you to play out that as a lifelong Democrat, he clerked for a Republican. 
I would like you to play DOWN that he’d never written a judicial opinion on abortion or 
revealed his thinking on Roe.

SAM
I’m already there.

TOBY
Well, thank you.

Sam looks at the television. It shows PETER LILLIENFIELD’S press conference.

SAM
What’s this?

TOBY
Lillienfield’s talking about something that’s bothering him today.

SAM
WHAT could possibly be less interesting? I’ll be in my office.

TOBY
Okay.

Sam leaves and closes the door. Toby goes back to writing. We hear the television.

LILLIENFIELD [on T.V.]
...Gone are the days of the best and the brightest. Stained, I believe, are the legacies 
of the great White House staffers. Names like Schlesinger, Sorenson, Rumsfeld, and Persons 
have been replaced by a roster of Ivy League liberals, Hollywood darlings. One in three of 
who, one in three... used drugs on a regular basis. 

A surprised Toby slowly looks at the television.

LILLIENFIELD [cont.]
And in case there should be any confusion about my meaning, I’m not talking about aspirin 
or decongestants...

Toby picks up the phone and dials.

LILLIENFIELD [cont.]
...Members of my staff will be passing out the most recent figures...

TOBY
[into phone] Get her.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
Carol knocks and comes in. C.J. is standing in front of the television, watching the 
press conference.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
Tell him I’m watching.

LILLIENFIELD [on T.V.]
...And to ask who exactly is it that’s helping lead our country, who has the ear of the 
president, advising the president... [continues]

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Leo and C.J. are walking.

LEO
One in three? 

C.J.
Yes.

LEO
He said one in three White House staffers were on drugs?

C.J.
Yes.

LEO
Where does he get these stats?

C.J.
Leo...

LEO
I mean where does he pull them from?

C.J.
Out of the clear blue sky, but that doesn’t matter.

They walk inside LEO’S OFFICE. Margaret is on her way out. 

LEO
Is somebody bringing me a tape of this?

MARGARET
They’re getting it. [leaves] 

Mandy is inside the office.

MANDY
This isn’t happening to me.

LEO
Nothing’s happening. Stay cool.

SAM
[pops his head and walks in] Is it possible for Peter Lillienfield to be a bigger 
jackass? You think if he tried hard, there’s room for him to be a slightly bigger 
horse’s ass than he’s being right now?

C.J.
At some point, you hit your head in the ceiling, don’t you?

SAM
I think there’s unexplored potential.

JOSH
[comes in] ‘Sup?

MANDY
Josh.

JOSH
Five White House staffers in the room. I would like to say to the 1.6 of you who are 
stoned right now, that it’s time to share.

Everyone laughs except Mandy.

MANDY
This isn’t funny, Josh.

JOSH
Mandy, if you can’t laugh at this, then you’re just not having enough fun in show business.

MANDY
Josh?

JOSH
He’s a featherweight, Mandy. He’s a hairdo.

SAM
I think if he put his shoulder into it, he could be a slightly bigger gasbag.

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
You know, if he really reach for the stars.

TOBY
[quickly walks in] Good morning.

C.J.
Hey.

TOBY
There’s no way you saw this coming?

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
Leo, I know I’m in your office. Forgive me. [yells] But nobody saw this coming?!

C.J.
Yeah. I can’t believe my psychic didn’t tell me, Toby. Rest assured, I’m gonna get 
my twenty bucks back.

LEO
Short-term, long-term?

JOSH
Short-term nothing.

C.J.
I can’t go with nothing.

JOSH
Why not?

C.J.
Pretend we didn’t see it?

JOSH
He’s a liar. He’s a fool. Categorically deny it and move on.

MANDY
She can’t.

C.J.
I can’t.

JOSH
Why not?

C.J.
Because more than 1300 people work for the White House, Josh. I go to the Press Room 
and categorically deny that anyone uses drugs, and it turns out that three guys in the 
photo lab blew a joint over the weekend, which is not like out of the realm of possibility. 
And my next question is...

MANDY
But you categorically denied it, now you admit there are three.

C.J.
Yes. Well, I categorically deny that there are any more than three.

Toby paces.

MANDY
But now it seems that the assistant to the deputy director of White House beverages--

JOSH
All right.

MANDY
--is confessing to a life of a closet junkie.

C.J.
Yes, and I understand she’s selling her story to Random House for a middle six-figure advance.

TOBY
[now has his head against the wall] All right. Are we done with Masterpiece Theater?

LEO
C.J., we’re looking into it, okay? 

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
That’s what we’re saying right now.

JOSH
I don’t care if we say that, but... we’re not actually looking into it, are we?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
This is a joke, right?

MARGARET
[walks in] Leo?

LEO
Yeah? Toby. [points at the staff]

TOBY
Yeah.

Leo walks away with Margaret.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Toby and the rest of the staff follow him as they walk out of Leo’S office.

TOBY
C.J., go do your briefing. The president paid a courtesy call on Crouch this morning. 
We got some exciting names. On the short list is Ed Harrison. We’ll introduce the nominee 
Thursday, 5 o’clock. This business with Lillienfield...

C.J.
I’ve heard about it, and I’d like the chance to see it first before I comment.

They all walk inside the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

TOBY
Is the president aware?

C.J.
We’d like to keep this things off the president’s desk until we measure what, if any, 
credibility...

TOBY
Good girl.

C.J. walks off. Toby, Josh, Mandy and Sam stop in front of Toby’s office.

MANDY
Toby, if the alternative is getting Harrison bumped off the top story...

TOBY
We’re not gonna postpone.

MANDY
Let’s end this fast.

JOSH
How?

MANDY
You know how.

JOSH
No, I don’t.

SAM
Mandy.

MANDY
What I’m saying...

TOBY
Go back to work, Mandy.

JOSH
Now, hang on a second. I’d like to hear what-

TOBY
Hey! Go back to work.

MANDY
Lillienfield is walking on a stage, and he’s not gonna get off until he gets off is 
what I’m saying.

JOSH
We are not taking drug tests.

MANDY
Why not?

JOSH
Because we’re not!

MANDY
Toby, let’s end this.

JOSH
Toby, if you...

TOBY
Shut up. [to Mandy] Go. [Mandy leaves.] Sam, go back to doing what you’re doing.

SAM
They just delivered five cartons of Harrison’s old papers.

TOBY
Then go start reading.

Sam goes inside his office.

JOSH
Toby...

TOBY
What do we know? What do they know?

JOSH
Now, wait, hang on a second. 

TOBY
Josh...

JOSH
You’re not making me--I’m not gonna be the internal affairs cop around here.

TOBY
Yes, you are.

JOSH
You want to know who’s doing what around here, you ask them yourself!

TOBY
This isn’t the time, Josh. We taking water over the side...

JOSH
Yes, and I’m not indifferent to that, but there’s a principle here-

TOBY
No, there’s not. Not this week. We’ve been doing this for a year, and all we’ve gotten is 
a year older. Our job approval’s 48%, and I think that number’s soft, and I’m tired of 
being the field captain for the gang that couldn’t shoot straight! We’re getting this done!
[beat] What do we know? What do they know? Start with me, if you want.

Toby goes into his office.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - MORNING
TUESDAY MORNINGH
The sun is not out yet. Sam is sleeping in his chair. Around him are a bunch of cartons 
containing old papers. The phone rings. He wakes up and picks up the phone.

SAM
Hello? This is Sam Seaborn. [listens] What’s your name? Uh, I’m not a cop. What’s your 
name? [listens] Where are you right now? [listens] All right. I’m the only one in my 
office, but as soon as the secretary get--you know what? Hang on. I’m on my way.
[hangs up the phone, wears his jacket, heads out, and trips over one of the cartons]
Ow!

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are headed for the Oval Office.

BARTLET
A quick confirmation’s gonna be good for us.

LEO
Ritter says we’ll get unanimous approval out of committee and 90 votes in the Senate.

BARTLET
That’s a blowout, Leo.

LEO
Mm-hmm.

BARTLET
Just what the doctor ordered. [An agent opens the door.] Thank you.

Bartlet and Leo walk inside the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning, Mr. President.

LEO
Good morning.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning.

BARTLET
When is Harrison getting in?

LEO
Late tonight.

BARTLET
Good.

They finally get to THE OVAL OFFICE. Charlie is inside.

BARTLET
Good morning, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Good morning, Mr. President.

LEO
Good morning.

BARTLET
Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his 
wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?

CHARLIE
Back channels, sir?

BARTLET
Yeah.

Charlie takes Bartlet’s jacket and leaves.

LEO
They’re gonna stake the hotels. Gifts coming from the White House...

BARTLET
We’re using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?

LEO
You’re staying out of it.

BARTLET
Fine.

LEO
Anything else?

BARTLET
We’re gonna get this done, right?

LEO
Yes sir.

BARTLET
All right.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[walks in] Mr. President?

BARTLET
I’m on my way.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Leo is on his way to his office.

BARTLET
Leo?

LEO
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
We looked at everybody, right?

LEO
Sir?

BARTLET
The short list. We looked at Mendoza?

LEO
We looked at him.

BARTLET
Leo...

LEO
We fixed on Harrison.

BARTLET
Yeah, you’re right. I’ll see you later.

LEO
Yes sir.

Leo goes into his office. Bartlet heads out into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Two military
types are waiting at the door.

BARTLET
Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s go.

Bartlet and the men walk out into the HALLWAY. Two Secret Service Agents are waiting.
They follow the president.

BARTLET
Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.

They all stop walking as Bartlet goes inside the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. The staffers
quickly stand up at the sight of the president.

STAFFER 1
Good morning.

BARTLET
Good morning. Keep your seats.

STAFFER 2
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good morning.

Bartlet goes into TOBY’S OFFICE. Toby is inside.

BARTLET
Good morning, Toby.

TOBY
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.

TOBY
Sir... it’s natural to have second thoughts, but...

BARTLET
No. I just want to be able to know something. There’s gonna be a lot of questions. 
I don’t want it to be “we had a Hispanic on the short list.”

TOBY
What is it you’re looking for?

BARTLET
The reason we didn’t go with him.

TOBY
The reason we didn’t go with him is because Harrison said yes.

BARTLET
Let’s do better than that.

TOBY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Uh, what’s going on with this drug thing?

TOBY
You don’t want a piece of that.

BARTLET
All right. I’ll trust ya. Thank you.

Bartlet walks back out to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. The staffers stand up again. 

SAM
[passes by] Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Good morning, Sam.

We follow Sam as he goes inside TOBY’S OFFICE.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
He wants me to look at Mendoza. What...?

SAM
[slams an envelope on Toby’s desk] I got a phone call before from a guy with some 
information. I just picked it up. I read it on the way back. It’s not good.

TOBY
Is it the drugs?

SAM
No.

TOBY
What is it?

SAM
It’s Harrison.

TOBY
Close the door.

Sam looks around the Communications Office and closes the door.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam is still there. Toby is going over through a bunch of papers.

SAM
It’s called an unsigned note. Every member of Law Review is required to prepare one. 
It’s like an article.

TOBY
I know what an unsigned note is.

SAM
It’s 40 or so pages, well researched, footnoted, and revised with faculty supervision, 
and it’s published.

TOBY
Without the names.

SAM
Without the names. It’s scholarly work.

TOBY
How do we know Harrison...?

SAM
Toby...

TOBY
What, I’m supposed to just trust “the guy on the phone?”

SAM
I spent the last three months reading everything Harrison’s written, from decisions, 
to memos, to amacus briefs, Toby. He’s the author of the unsigned note.

TOBY
[pause, calls] Bonnie!

BONNIE
[opens the door] Yeah?

TOBY
I’m gonna need the next five minutes the president’s got.

BONNIE
Yeah.

Bonnie leaves and closes the door. Toby looks at Sam.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Josh and Donna are walking.

DONNA
How does Lillienfield get his information?

JOSH
Ah, he’s got a half government oversight committee. These are the people who literally 
decide if we get heat and electricity in the White House.

They go near the JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
Josh is getting himself coffee. Then they walk again.

DONNA
So they have access to background information?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
You shouldn’t feel uncomfortable about interviewing me.

JOSH
I met you. I talked to you. I hired you. You know anybody around here who uses drugs?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
You want to tell me who they are?

DONNA
No.

JOSH
Good for you. Consider yourself interviewed.

DONNA
You’re a good boy, Josh.

JOSH
Donna, I’ve seen your records.

DONNA
I know.

JOSH
You need to learn that “no parking” means no parking.

DONNA
The thing is sometimes I can’t find a space.

JOSH
Go to work.

Donna goes to her desk. Josh goes inside his OFFICE. Mandy is sitting at the table 
beside the door.

MANDY
We have everyone take a drug test and be done with it.

JOSH
What makes you think that everyone here can pass a drug test?

MANDY
The ones who can’t already know it and will quietly resign. 

JOSH
[laughs] Oh, okay. Problem solved.

MANDY
What is wrong in this day and age with demonstrating that the White House is drug free? 
What is wrong with giving people that comfort?

JOSH
I would think that in this day and age, people would be more comfortable knowing that they 
will not now, nor will they ever be forced to turn over evidence against themselves. And 
please, do not try and paint your position as anything other than preservation of a spotlight.

MANDY
This thing gets bungled, and we’re not gonna have to struggle much to find the spotlight.

JOSH
[pause] So what do you think’s really going on here?

MANDY
I don’t know.

JOSH
I don’t know either.

MANDY
That’s what makes me nervous.

JOSH
What do we do?

MANDY
It’s time to talk to whoever it is you talk to.

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is doing the briefing. A reporter asks a question.

REPORTER
Is there any reason to believe that White House staffers regularly use illegal drugs?

C.J.
For those who didn’t understand me the first nine times, we are looking into this.

REPORTER
C.J.?

STEVE
C.J., would you forgive a blunt question?

C.J.
These questions haven’t been blunt yet?

STEVE
Do you use drugs?

C.J.
No, and you’re forgiven.

CHRIS
It’s been 24 hours since Congressman Lillienfield made his accusations, C.J. When is the 
White House...?

C.J.
We have 1300 people on the payroll, Chris. That’s a lot of information to gather, and 
it’s not like we were loaded with free time before. And let me just add that as no one 
and nothing here has been subpoenaed, and Mr. Lillienfield has offered nothing to support 
his very bizarre claim, we’re not feeling the real need to get this done in a hurry.

CHRIS
C.J., one more question...

C.J.
Thank you. That’s all. [walks away, to a staffer] Set fire to the room. Do it now.

The staffer laughs as C.J. walks out into the HALLWAY. C.J. does not see Danny following her.

DANNY
How you doing?

C.J.
What do you want?

DANNY
It was a bit of a blunder back there.

C.J.
It was fine.

DANNY
You challenged Lillienfield to present evidence. He knows his cue when he hears it.

C.J.
[looks around] I left my notebook somewhere.

DANNY
Also, did you really want to be the first person to use the word “subpoena”?

C.J.
In the context?

DANNY
What the context was. It’s the only word anybody’s gonna read tomorrow.

C.J.
I really don’t need your tips, Danny.

DANNY
As a matter of fact, you do, C.J. but that’s not why I’m here.

C.J.
Why are you here?

DANNY
I’m here because there’s a basketball team called the New York Knickerbockers who are 
playing in town tonight.

C.J. and Danny go back to THE BRIEFING ROOM. The reporters have left, and it’s now empty 
and dark.

C.J.
I don’t have time for a little basketball game!

DANNY
Neither do I. Which is why we I thought could watch it in your office while I explain it 
to you in a patronizing manner, ‘cause I know it’s something women usually like.

C.J.
Thank you, anyway.

DANNY
You understand I’ll talk slow and explain it the way any girl would appreciate.

C.J. walks out. Josh has come in the room through the back door. Danny turns around.

JOSH
Danny. You got a minute?

DANNY
Walk me to my car.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
Josh and Danny are walking along a street.

DANNY
Josh, the information I get I have to print.

JOSH
Do you have any information?

DANNY
No.

JOSH
Would you tell me if you did?

DANNY
What kind of information?

JOSH
You know what kind of information.

DANNY
Hey.

JOSH
You know no one knows where I got it.

DANNY
You know in the highroad, I’m not supposed to hand out any information I get.

JOSH
You’re right.

DANNY
You know I’m right. It’s not my job to help you out. As a matter of fact, I get fired 
from my job for helping you out.

JOSH
I know that.

DANNY
Lillienfield’s a jackass, but he’s not stupid. He’s talking. He’s got something. 

JOSH
What?

DANNY
Whatever it is it’s small potatoes. It’s enough to get the rock rolling down the mountain.

JOSH
What’s he trying to hit?

DANNY
I don’t know.

JOSH
Is it the nomination?

DANNY
That’s what I thought too, but Harrison’s gonna sail by no matter what.

JOSH
Nobody said it’s Harrison.

DANNY
Yeah. Yeah. My point is this: He’s not gonna waste it on a done deal. He’s after 
something better.

JOSH
Okay. Thanks. [starts to walk the other way]

DANNY
Josh, it’s one of those times, man. Don’t screw this up.

JOSH
C.J. likes goldfish.

DANNY
What?

JOSH
She likes goldfish. Can’t get enough of them.

DANNY
Thanks!

Josh walks away.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is holding some papers. Sam and Toby are with him. 

BARTLET
Here’s an interesting statement. [reads] “I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying 
my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless 
specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.” Unquote.

SAM
Mr. President, this paper, is, in no uncertain terms, an argument of privacy is not a 
right guaranteed by the Constitution.

BARTLET
Why isn’t this ever been brought up?

TOBY
It never came up, sir.

BARTLET
We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn’t believe in a privacy guarantee, 
and it never came up?

TOBY
It was simply never an issue in any order to be handed down, and if I may sir, we don’t 
know for sure that he’s the author of the document...

SAM
We do know.

TOBY
...If he is, I don’t think we can necessarily hold a 55 year old man responsible...

SAM
Toby?

TOBY
...for something he wrote when he’s 26.

SAM
We’re not gonna be able to hold him responsible if we put him on the bench. And I promise 
you, this issue’s gonna come up!

BARTLET
[pause, sighs] When does Harrison get in?

SAM
Later tonight.

BARTLET
I want him first thing in the morning.

SAM
Yes sir.

BARTLET
When was the last time either of you slept, I don’t care. Get ready for this.

TOBY
Yes sir.

SAM
Thank you, Mr. President.

TOBY
Thank you sir.

Toby and Sam leave.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is meeting with a few people.

LEO
Seventeen billion isn’t gonna fly. They’re gonna say it’s too much at thirteen five.

The door to the Oval Office opens. Bartlet comes in. Everyone stands.

BARTLET
Excuse me.

LEO
Give us the room. [The people leave at an instant.]

BARTLET
I want to meet Mendoza.

LEO
Yes sir.

Bartlet walks back to the Oval Office.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
THURSDAY MORNING
Toby and Sam are waiting to be called inside the Oval Office. Mandy is with them, 
walking back and forth.

TOBY
Does Mendoza know why he’s coming here?

MANDY
He thinks he’s interviewing for a place in the President’s Commission for Hispanic 
Opportunity.

TOBY
Is there such a thing as the president’s...?

MANDY
It’s the best I could do in short notice, Toby.

TOBY
Fine.

MANDY
I had to make a letterhead.

TOBY
That must have taxed your considerable creativity.

MANDY
Toby?

TOBY
Fine.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is inside with Judge PEYTON CABOT HARRISON III. Charlie is waiting at the door.

BARTLET
Judge Harrison, first thing’s first, are you the author of this unsigned note?

Bartlet gives several papers to Harrison, who looks it over. 

HARRISON
[chuckles] Yes sir.

BARTLET
When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers. 
Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and 
trying to make some noise.

HARRISON 
Yes sir.

BARTLET
I’m gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.

HARRISON
That’s fine sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Charlie, please?

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Toby, Mandy and Sam are still waiting. Josh appears behind them.

JOSH
Toby, you got a minute?

TOBY
They’re about to call me in.

Josh and Toby go out into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Privacy?

TOBY
I don’t know.

JOSH
He doesn’t acknowledge the protection?

TOBY
Hang on a second.

JOSH
When were you gonna tell me this?

TOBY
Number one: I don’t report to you.

JOSH
Toby...

TOBY
Number two: He wrote the paper a quarter century ago.

JOSH
He hasn’t changed his mind.

TOBY
We don’t know whether he changed his mind or not.

JOSH
We don’t care whether he changed his mind or not. You’re painting a picture for the president.

TOBY
The president can paint his own picture.

JOSH
Yeah, but he listens to you. [beat] When did we get the idea that Harrison was our guy? 
When we used to talk it was never Harrison.

CHARLIE
[walks up] Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

CHARLIE
They’re ready for you.

Charlie and Toby go inside. Josh walks the other way.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is seated in a chair, reading. Margaret knocks and comes in.

MARGARET
Leo?

LEO
Yeah?

MARGARET
Josh was wondering if you had a moment.

LEO
Yeah.

Margaret leaves. Josh comes in.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
Hey. 

Josh closes the door.

LEO
I guess you’re the guy with the worst job in the building this week, huh?

JOSH
[laughs] I was interrogating this intern from the Legislative Liaison’s Office, and 
she broke down crying while telling me about the bong she had made out of an eggplant.

LEO
You can do that?

JOSH
I used to use a potato.

LEO
You’ve always been industrious.

JOSH
[goes around and sits across Leo] Lillienfield’s not after that kid in the Liaison’s 
Office, and he’s not even after the Senior Staff.

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
Leo, you... know the worst kept secret in Washington... is that you’re a recovering 
alcoholic, right?

LEO
I had a hunch.

They both chuckle.

JOSH
Leo, you’re... Boston-Irish Catholic. Back there and back then, a drinking problem 
wasn’t a problem. [beat] This isn’t what he’s after... Were you maybe into something 
that wasn’t so acceptable?

LEO
[pause] Pills.

JOSH
Were you in treatment?

LEO
Sierra-Tucson. Six years ago.

JOSH
Leo...

LEO
Records kept by these facilities are confidential, Josh.

JOSH
[quietly] He’s got ‘em.

Leo is shocked. Josh grabs Leo by his jacket and pats him.

JOSH
You’re Leo McGarry. You’re not gonna be taken down by this... small fraction of a man.
[stands and opens the door] I won’t permit it.

Josh leaves and closes the door. Leo is still shocked.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and Harrison are now with Sam and Toby.

HARRISON
Judges are bound to interpret the Constitution within the strict parameters of the text 
itself. The Constitution doesn’t provide for a right of privacy. The right doesn’t exist.

SAM
The third amendment says soldiers can’t be quartered in private homes. The fifth provides 
protection against self-incrimination, and the fourth against unreasonable searches. 
You deny the right to privacy lived in those passages?

HARRISON
No. I do not deny it, but the fact that the framers enumerated those specific protections is 
all the more reason to believe that they had no intention of making privacy a de facto right.

SAM
They just fought a revolution but they had no question of their freedom. The Bill of Rights 
wasn’t meant to codify the most crucial of those rights not to limit the others.

HARRISON
I do this for a living, Mr. Seaborn.

SAM
So do I, your honor.

BARTLET
Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and 
walk down Main Street?

HARRISON
Yes.

BARTLET
Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?

HARRISON
First Amendment. Freedom of expression.

BARTLET
What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument 
to be made there?

HARRISON
No.

BARTLET
So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream 
in coffee?

HARRISON
I would have strong objection, Mr. President, as I like cream as well, but I would have no 
Constitutional basis to strike down the law when you brought this case to the Supreme Court.

BARTLET
As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is going over some newspapers. Danny comes in carrying a fishbowl, with a goldfish 
swimming inside.

DANNY
Hey.

C.J.
Hey. 

DANNY
What you doing?

C.J.
You were right.

DANNY
I know.

C.J.
The word “subpoena” appears in the lead in every story of this morning’s papers.

DANNY
I know.

C.J.
Not yours.

DANNY
That’s just ‘cause I couldn’t spell it.

C.J.
What are you holding?

DANNY
It’s a goldfish.

C.J.
Why?

DANNY
It’s for you.

C.J.
Really?

DANNY
Josh said you liked goldfish.

C.J. suddenly bursts out in laughter. Danny is puzzled.

C.J.
[out of her laugh] The crackers, Danny. The cheese things that you have at a party?

DANNY
Well... You know what, I’m not a hundred percent sure I’m supposed to know that.

C.J.
The crackers, Danny.

DANNY
Fine. Now I got a goldfish.

C.J.
[laughs] Give it to me.

DANNY
No.

C.J.
No, you’ll kill it.

DANNY
You think I can’t take care of a goldfish?

C.J.
I absolutely do not. [takes the fishbowl from Danny]

DANNY
The name’s Gail, by the way.

C.J.
The fish?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
You named it Gail?

DANNY
No, the guy in the store.

C.J.
[laughs again] Oh... That’s... Come here. [kisses Danny on the cheek] Thanks for the fish.

DANNY
Keep your head in the game.

Danny leaves. C.J. looks at the goldfish in the table. She looks at the door, and laughs 
once more.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

SAM
In 1787, there was a sizable block of delegates who were initially opposed to the 
Bill of Rights. One member of the Georgia delegation had to stay by way of opposition: 
“If we list the set of rights, some fools in the future are going to claim that people 
are entitled only to those rights enumerated and no longer. The framers knew...”

HARRISON
Were you just calling me a fool, Mr. Seaborn?

SAM
I wasn’t calling you a fool, sir, the brand new state of Georgia was.

HARRISON
Gentlemen, laws must emanate from the Constitution.

TOBY
There are natural laws, judge.

HARRISON
I do not deny there are natural laws, Mr. Ziegler. I only deny that judges are empowered 
to enforce them.

TOBY
Then who will?

HARRISON
That’s not up to me. And this sideshow is over. With all due respect, Mr. President, I 
find this kind of questioning very rude.

SAM
Well then, you’re really gonna enjoy meeting the U.S. Senate.

HARRISON
Be that as it may, it’s disgusting. We all know you need me as much as I need you. I read 
the same polling information you do. Seven to ten point bump, 90 votes, unanimous out of 
committee, I was courted. Now, you have me taken to school by some kid.

Sam reacts to the remark.

BARTLET
This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that’s 
what I told him to do.

HARRISON
I am an extremely well credentialed man, Mr. President, and I’m unaccustomed to this sort 
of questioning.

BARTLET
I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We’ll make you comfortable 
while you’re waiting.

HARRISON
Certainly.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Everyone stands as Harrison exits. 

SAM
Put him on a bus.

TOBY
With a guaranteed confirmation we’re sending out the door based on a 30-year-old paper, 
which by the way, no one will know about but us.

BARTLET
You don’t think the guy who called Sam wouldn’t know how to call a senator’s office?

TOBY
Mr. President, if this is really about abortion, we already talked about...

SAM
It’s not about abortion. It’s about the next 20 years. Twenties and thirties, it was 
the role of government. Fifties and sixties, it was civil rights. The next two decades, 
it’s gonna be privacy. I’m talking about the Internet. I’m talking about cellphones. 
I’m talking about health records, and who’s gay and who’s not. And moreover, in a 
country born on a will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this?

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
[beat] Let’s meet Mendoza.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Mandy knocks. Josh is inside looking out the window.

MANDY
They’re meeting with Mendoza.

JOSH
Yeah.

MANDY
Yeah, and I’m just gonna go kill myself now.

JOSH
You think Mendoza would be a bad justice?

MANDY
I think Mendoza would make a great justice. I think he makes a lousy nominee.

JOSH
Why?

MANDY
He’s ruled in favor of same sex marriages...

JOSH
He didn’t rule in favor of it, Mandy. He’s not recommending it. He’s ruled that the state 
has no right to interfere with it.

MANDY
He’s got the broadest possible interpretation for free speech.

JOSH
And listening to you sometimes, I honestly wish you’d narrow it, so...

MANDY
You don’t have to tell me how to be a good person, Josh. I’m the one who has to sell this. 
And he is not exactly America’s idea of Supreme Court justice.

JOSH
Mandy, I don’t...

MANDY
Let’s do a side-by-side comparison. [reads from piece of paper] Harrison went to Walnut 
Park Country Day, Phillips Exeter, and Princeton undergrad, and Harvard Law. Mendoza 
attended P.S. 138 in Brooklyn, City University of New York, and the New York Police 
Department. Harrison clerked for Warren Berger. Mendoza...

JOSH
[off of the top of his head] New York City Police Department ’65 to ’76, Assistant 
District Attorney Brooklyn ’76 to ’80, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eastern District, Federal 
District Judge, Eastern District -- Let me tell you something, Mendoza went to Law School 
the hard way. He got shot in the leg, and when they offered him a hundred percent 
dispensation, he took a desk job instead and went to law school at night. He’s brilliant, 
decisive, compassionate, and experienced. And if you don’t think that he’s America’s 
idea of a jurist, then you don’t have enough faith in Americans.

MANDY
It’s not Americans I don’t have faith in, Josh. It’s the White House Senior Staff.

Josh scoffs.

MANDY
This is not gonna be an easy one, and if all hell breaks loose over Lillienfield, 
it could honestly cripple us for a year, maybe more.

JOSH
[sighs] Well, I mean, just the law of large numbers says We got to win one one of 
these days, right?

MANDY
Yeah.

JOSH
So let’s make it a good one.

MANDY
I still hate you.

JOSH
Whatever.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Judge ROBERTO MENDOZA and two staffers are walking along the hallway. They pass the 
Communications Office. Margaret and Ed are at the door when the walk by.

ED
Who was that?

MARGARET
Roberto Mendoza.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
Inside the closed room, Harrison is standing waiting. Charlie is seated at the corner.

HARRISON
It’s not necessary for you to stay here.

CHARLIE
The president asked me to stay with you in case you needed anything. I’d be glad to stay 
outside if you prefer.

HARRISON
Yes, please.

CHARLIE
Would you like anything?

HARRISON
Coffee, please.

CHARLIE
Yes sir. [about to head out]

HARRISON
You look very familiar. Is it possible we’ve met?

CHARLIE
I caddied for two summers at Sandy Hooks, sir.

HARRISON
Ah. Yes, of course.

CHARLIE
Charlie Young.

HARRISON
Charlie, of course.

CHARLIE
I’ll get your coffee. [leaves and closes the door]

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Toby and Sam are now meeting with Mendoza.

BARTLET
I’m sure we’re almost done. Sam, what else you got?

SAM
Judge Mendoza, I have a note that your rulings have been upheld by the Court of Appeals 
more than any other district judge in the country.

MENDOZA
Well, that’s what comes by being right most of the time, I guess.

Bartlet laughs. Leo walks in.

BARTLET
You need me, Leo?

LEO
For just a moment, sir.

BARTLET
Would you excuse me?

MENDOZA
Certainly.

Bartlet and Leo walk into LEO’S OFFICE. Leo closes the door.

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
What is it, Leo?

LEO
There’s gonna be trouble.

BARTLET
Lillienfield?

LEO
Yes sir.

BARTLET
He knows?

LEO
We think so.

BARTLET
We?

LEO
Josh has it.

BARTLET
What does Josh say?

LEO
Get through it.

BARTLET
Josh is a smart guy.

LEO
No sir. Josh is a young guy.

BARTLET
We used to be too.

LEO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Did you have a drink yesterday?

LEO
No sir.

BARTLET
Are you gonna have one today?

LEO
No sir.

BARTLET
That’s all you ever have to say to me.

LEO
You know it’s gonna make things very hard for a while.

BARTLET
You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you 
one, don’t you?

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Leo go back in. Charlie approaches Bartlet and whispers.

CHARLIE
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Did Harrison get off okay?

CHARLIE
Yes sir. There’s a crowd building outside your office.

BARTLET
Why?

CHARLIE
I think word’s gotten out what’s going on in here, sir.

BARTLET
I’ll bet it has. [turns to Sam] Do you have any more questions, Sam?

SAM
No sir.

TOBY
I have one, sir.

MENDOZA
Let me say that this is not an easy commission to get appointed to.

TOBY
Judge, without knowing details of special circumstance, what would you say of someone 
being fired from refusing to take a drug test at the order of the president?

MENDOZA
Without details of special circumstances?

TOBY
Yes sir.

MENDOZA
Without showing cause, I would say that the order constitutes an illegal search, and 
I would order that the employee be reinstated.

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
Sold.

BARTLET
Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name 
has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?

MENDOZA
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o’clock, I am 
naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme 
Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one. 
[beat] Will you accept the nomination?

MENDOZA
[beat] With honor.

BARTLET
Good.

Everyone stands.

BARTLET
Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.

SAM
Congratulations, Judge.

MENDOZA
Thank you. [shake hands]

TOBY
It’s gonna be an excruciating battle, Mr. Justice, one I have no intention of losing.

BARTLET
What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?

LEO
I believe I have one in me, yes sir.

BARTLET
Good. Let the good fight begin.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
A large crowd is waiting just outside the Oval Office. Bartlet opens the door.

BARTLET
Mr. Justice Mendoza!

Mendoza walks out with Sam, Toby, and Leo. Staffers outside, including Josh, Mandy, 
C.J. and Donna are clapping. Mendoza shakes hands with C.J. and then Josh. He makes 
his way down the line of people with the staff following behind him, as everyone 
continues to clap for the nominee.

West Wing S01E10
As Christmas Eve approaches, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) eagerly sneaks out of the White House for some last-minute Christmas shopping, while a haunted Toby (Richard Schiff) learns more about a forgotten Korean War hero who died alone on the district's cold streets wearing a coat that Toby once donated to charity. In other hushed corridors, Sam (Rob Lowe) and Josh (Bradley Whitford) ignore Leo's (John Spencer) advice and consult Sam's call girl friend (Lisa Edelstein) concerning her confidential clientele when one political rival hints at exposing Leo's previous drug problem. C.J. (Allison Janney) wonders aloud about the President's public response to a notorious hate crime while her personal resolve weakens as persistent reporter, Danny (Timothy Busfield) continues to ask her out.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST LOBBY - MORNING
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 23, 7:30 A.M.
A large, decorated Christmas tree stands in the middle of the lobby. Mandy and C.J. 
discuss the White House holiday celebration, while Toby stands around uninterested, 
reading a newspaper. Staffers are hurrying around decorating the lobby with plants, 
flags, lights, etc.

MANDY
The President will stand next to the tree with flag on the left and the carolers 
will be off to the side.

C.J. 
With the Santa hats on?

MANDY
No. Dickensian costumes.

C.J.
Nice.

MANDY
Maybe we’ll have both.

C.J.
You think?

MANDY
You think they’ll clash?

C.J.
Might.

TOBY
Someone tell me why I’m standing here.

C.J.
To weigh in on this.

TOBY
I could care less.

MANDY
Toby.

TOBY
More?

SAM
[walks up] Who’s playing Santa?

MANDY
Al Roker.

SAM
Playing Santa?

MANDY
What’s wrong with that?

SAM
Went on a diet.

TOBY
How do you know these things?

SAM
I read.

MANDY
We’ll pad them if we have to. Now, we have Jose Feliciano, we have Sammy Sosa and his wife...

SAM
Did you know that recordings of “Feliz Navidad” outsold recordings of “White Christmas?”

TOBY
What are you?

SAM
I am fully briefed.

MANDY
So he speaks.

TOBY
On what?

SAM
Pageant of peace, season of hope, coming of the new millennium.

TOBY
Coming of the new millennium?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
Fine.

SAM
Don’t start.

TOBY
I said fine.

MANDY
Would you two guys stop?

C.J.
Are we done?

MANDY
Yeah.

Mandy stays behind as C.J., Sam, and Toby start to walk through the HALLWAYS to their 
offices.

TOBY
It’s not the new millennium, but I’ll just let it drop.

SAM
It is.

TOBY
It is not the new millennium. The year 2000 is the last year of the millennium. It’s not 
the first one of the next.

SAM
But the common sensibility, to quote Steven J. Gould...

TOBY
Steven J. Gould needs to look at a calendar.

SAM
Gould says that this is a largely unreasonable issue. 

TOBY
Yes, it’s tough to resolve. Yes, you have to look at a calendar.

They walk through the Roosevelt Room where several other staffers are working, when 
Ginger calls him.

GINGER
Toby.

TOBY
What?

GINGER
Phone call.

TOBY
I’m arguing now, I’ll call them back.

GINGER
It’s the D.C. police.

C.J., Sam and Toby stop on their tracks, and turn to face Ginger.

TOBY
What do they want?

GINGER
They want you.

TOBY
Huh. [walks away]

Sam and C.J. as they walk out of the Roosevelt Room into another HALLWAY.

SAM
You got to ask yourself which is more exciting, watching your car roll over from 99,999 
to 100,000, or watching it go from 100 to 101?

C.J.
So technically the millennium is still a year away? 

SAM
Yeah, but we’ve made all these plans.

They pass by a Secret Service agent, DONNIE.

C.J.
Donnie, would you tell them I’m on my way over to see the President?

DONNIE
[into mike] Flamingo is on her way.

Sam turns the corner, but C.J. whips around when she hears what Donnie called her.

C.J.
Who? What did you call... what did he call me?

Sam reaches from off camera and pulls her away.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL - DAY
Early morning, we pan through the monuments, memorials, benches, and visitors. Toby approaches 
a police officer standing in front of a bench, where a man, covered with blankets, lies.

TOBY
Excuse me.

OFFICER
Yep.

TOBY
I’m Toby Zeigler.

OFFICER
Where you been?

TOBY
I was at the coroner’s office. They told me to come here.

The officer pulls back the blanket to reveal the face of the man. He’s dead.

OFFICER
Do you know this man?

Toby, uncomfortable, comes closer and looks at the man.

TOBY
No.

OFFICER
You sure?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
His last name is Hufnagle, if that rings a bell. 

TOBY
No.

OFFICER
He had a driver’s license on him, expired in 1973. Hufnagle, Walter.

TOBY
Why’d you call me?

OFFICER
He also had your business card.

TOBY
Did he?

OFFICER
You Toby Zeigler?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
From the White House?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
And he had your business card?

TOBY looks bewildered. Then after a moment a look of comprehension comes over his face.

TOBY
Well, that’s my coat. I gave that coat to the Goodwill. There must have been a... 

OFFICER
The card was in it... Well, that explains that. Well, thanks for your time.

TOBY
Yeah. [starts to leave, but turns] Listen, this isn’t a crime scene is it?

OFFICER
No, sir.

TOBY
See, I got the call an hour ago, I went to the coroner’s office. I’m just wondering why 
the body’s still here.

OFFICER
An ambulance will come by. It’s not a high priority. 

TOBY
And then you’re gonna call the V.A. right?

OFFICER
The V.A.?

TOBY
[points] Tattoo on his forearm is Marine Battalion Second of the Seventh. This guy 
was in Korea.

OFFICER
Huh... Thanks.

The officer covers the man with the blanket again. Toby looks slightly bothered by the 
officer’s casual attitude towards the deceased man.

TOBY
Yeah, thanks.

OFFICER
Merry Christmas.

TOBY
[almost to himself] Merry Christmas.

Toby walks away, pausing to look at the deceased veteran once more. His whole demeanor 
is troubled.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Donna approaches Josh in the very festively decorated bullpen, as several staffers are 
busy working around them.
 
DONNA
Good morning, Josh.

JOSH
Good morning Donna, and a Merry Christmas to you and your whole Protestant family.

DONNA
Thank you.

JOSH
As you can see I have not yet bought your Christmas present.

DONNA
Yes, and I know you’re agonizing over how to best express your appreciation and affection 
for me at this time of the year.

JOSH
That and how I scrape together the ten bucks.

DONNA
I’ve prepared a list. 

She gives him a small piece of paper as they continue to walk.

JOSH
Of Christmas gift suggestions?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
[reads] “Ski pants, ski boots, ski hat, ski goggles, ski gloves, ski poles.” I’m assuming 
you already have skis?

DONNA
Page two?

JOSH
Right.

They cut the corner into a HALLWAY.

DONNA
Just pick something off the list, and, you know, feel free to pick two things.

JOSH
I should feel that freedom?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Thanks.

DONNA
I want to learn how to ski.

JOSH
Why?

DONNA
I like the equipment.

JOSH
Okay.

DONNA
Where you going?

JOSH
I, uh, need to speak to Leo.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
He wants to talk about your Christmas present.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
So you’ll think about the skis?

JOSH
Yeah. I’ll give that a lot of thought.

Donna walks off. Josh waits until her back is turned before crumpling up her list and 
throwing into a wastebasket. Josh then enters MARGARET’S OFFICE. Nobody inside.

JOSH
Hello!

LEO [OS]
Come on back.

JOSH goes into LEO’S OFFICE. Leo is sitting in front of brightly wrapped Christmas 
presents in the table. Margaret is standing next to him with her clipboard. She is 
having trouble with her pen.

MARGARET
Good morning, Josh.

JOSH
This is quite an operation.

MARGARET
[lacking feeling] We like to spread holiday cheer.

Her tone clearly indicates that she and Leo have spread so much holiday cheer, that 
they have none left for themselves.

LEO
[looking at a card] Who the hell is this guy and why do I care if he has a Merry Christmas?

MARGARET
Just sign the damn thing.

LEO
Leave us alone for a minute.

MARGARET
We’re not done yet.

LEO
Two minutes!

MARGARET
Sure.

Margaret grabs her clipboard and heads towards her office, but not before shooting an 
unhappy look at Leo before closing the door.

JOSH
I’m tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
Lillienfield’s got this information. He’s gonna hold it till after Christmas when people 
are watching. I don’t want to tell you too much, but I want to make an attempt at a 
preemptive strike.

LEO
Well, you got to tell me more than that.

JOSH
Sam knows a girl.

LEO
I’ve heard rumors.

JOSH
I want to talk to her.

LEO
Nope.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
Absolutely not.

JOSH
I’m saying--

LEO
Josh!

JOSH
I’m saying something to keep in our pockets.

LEO
I don’t want it in my pocket. I don’t want it in your pocket, Sam’s pocket, and I sure 
don’t want it in the President’s pocket.

JOSH
Lillienfield is coming down the mountain. Leo, this is no joke.

LEO
You don’t have to tell me it’s no joke, Josh. It’s my life. All I’m saying is we don’t 
do these things.

JOSH
[a little too quickly] All right. 

LEO
All right?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Listen, you hear about this kid in Minnesota?

JOSH
No.

LEO
A gay high school senior. He got beaten up, then they stripped him naked, tied him to a 
tree and threw rocks and bottles at his head. You know how old the assailants were? Thirteen.

JOSH
[beat] Is the kid dead?

LEO
He’s in critical condition. This is all by way of saying we’re gonna have to revisit hate 
crimes legislation after the break.

JOSH
Oh, well we ought to gauge reaction before we say anything.

LEO
C.J.’s gonna send up a test balloon at her briefing. 

JOSH
All right.

LEO
Margaret!

MARGARET
[comes in] Yes, sir?

LEO
Let’s get this over with.

JOSH
See you later.

LEO
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is holding a briefing.

C.J.
The President is scheduled to leave for New Hampshire tomorrow morning at precisely 
10 a.m. on the dot, no hold ups, no delays, which means he ought to be leaving around 
noon. He’ll spend Christmas Eve at the Manchester house, then attend Christmas services 
with his family in the morning.

BOBBI
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

BOBBI
Is the White House aware that a high school student was attacked?

C.J.
Yeah, his name is Lowell Lydell, he’s seventeen years old, he’s in critical condition 
at Saint Paul Memorial Hospital with a severely fractured skull, massive internal 
hemorrhaging, and various broken bones and lacerations. We’ll keep you updated through 
local authorities.

BOBBI
Do you think that this will revisit the debate on hate crime legislation?

C.J.
Yes, I do. Though I suppose the best time to do that was the day before Lowell Lydell 
got his brains beaten out and not the day after. Who’s next?
 
CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Toby is leaning against his desk, which has several books about the Korean War on it. 
He is looking at a notepad and talking on the phone.

TOBY
[on the phone] Walter Hufnagle. I don’t know... I don’t know! I’ve been holding on for-- 
I say I’ve been holding on for the better part of-- Sure. Yeah.

MANDY
[knocks] Are you busy?

TOBY
I’m holding.

MANDY
What’s going on?

TOBY
A homeless Korean War Vet died of exposure out on the mall last night. I don’t know if 
his family’s been contacted, I don’t know... what kind of burial...

MANDY
How do you know him?

TOBY
I don’t.

MANDY
Then what does it matter to you?

TOBY
Don’t worry about it. What do you need?

MANDY
This might seem trivial under the circumstances. 

TOBY
What?

MANDY
The Santa hats do clash with the Dickensian costumes. 

TOBY
It might seem trivial?

MANDY
Just keeping you in the loop.

TOBY
[into phone] Yes, I’m here. 
[to Mandy] Go away. 

MANDY
Yeah, I know. [leaves] 

Toby listens on the phone for a moment, then pulls it away from his ear in disgust, 
then brings it back to listen.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is walking back to his office when approached by Donna.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
I need to talk to you.

JOSH
Donna, I can assure you I’m giving your Christmas list the consideration it...

DONNA
Seriously. [They stop] What’s going on with Leo?

Josh looks at her for a moment, and then closes his door to give them some privacy.

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
I just heard something.

JOSH
From who?

DONNA
From Margaret.

JOSH
The two of you shouldn’t be...

DONNA
Yeah, but we did.

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
Is it true?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Well?

JOSH
Well, what?

DONNA
What are you gonna do?

JOSH
For the moment nothing, we’re gonna--

DONNA
Josh... 

JOSH
We’re gonna wait and see how-- 

DONNA
You’re gonna wait and see?

JOSH
There’s not much else we can do.

DONNA
We’ll wait and see?

JOSH
Yes. 

She gives Josh a very sympathetic look.

JOSH
Could you stop looking at me with the face?

DONNA
It’s my face.

JOSH
Like I just killed your hamster?

DONNA
[rolls her eyes] I just think if the tables were turned... 

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
If one of us were in trouble, he would be the first person to-- 

JOSH
I know! [beat] I know.

DONNA
It was my regular face, Josh. I wasn’t trying to guilt you.

JOSH
I know... I have to work.

DONNA
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
C.J. is leading a couple dozen small schoolchildren into the room. The children look 
in awe at the magnificent Christmas tree in the middle of the room. Reporters are 
standing around behind velvet ropes to snapping away pictures.

C.J.
Okay kids, remember the drill, in a big voice you’ll say your name, your grade and then 
you’ll ask the President the question that you and your teacher have prepared and 
written down on your index card. [glances up to an agent, who nods subtlely]
[to kids] Okay, how about a big, “Good morning Mr. President!” when he comes in the 
room? Here we go.

C.J. steps aside as Bartlet comes around the corner and walks in front of the kids.

KIDS
Good morning Mr. President!

BARTLET
Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let’s try it again. [cups his ear]

KIDS
Good morning, Mr. President!

BARTLET
That’s better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor? 
[points to a young boy] You! What’s your name?

JEFFREY
Jeffrey Lucas.

BARTLET
And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?

JEFFREY
[laughs] I’m seven.

BARTLET
Well, all right then, you’re fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I’m a busy man. I am, 
after all, the President of Bulgaria.

KIDS
No!

C.J. laughs at the Bartlet’s antics.

BARTLET
Now, wait a second. That’s not right. I’m not the President of Bulgaria. I am the 
President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg.

KIDS
Noooo!

BARTLET
Now hold on, I know I’m the President of something... 

KIDS
America!

BARTLET
Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?

KIDS
Me! Me! Me!

He points to a cute, little girl with glasses, and kneels down in front of her.

BARTLET
Yes, ma’am.

JESSICA
My name is Jessica Hodges, and I’m in the third grade, and this is my question: 
What’s your favorite part about being President?

BARTLET
My favorite part about being President?

JESSICA
Yes.

BARTLET
I’m doing it right now. [kisses the girl on the forehead] Who’s next? All right. 

KIDS
Me! Me! Me!

C.J. approaches.

BARTLET
[to kids] Wait. Hang on a second.

C.J. whispers something to him.

BARTLET
Okay. [to the kids] Apparently, there’s a group of kids in the other room that I might 
like better.

KIDS
No!

Bartlet and C.J. walk over to the foray where Charlie is standing. 

CHARLIE
I’m sorry to interrupt, sir, but you asked me to keep you posted.

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Lowell Lydell died about 15 minutes ago.

The bad news hits him. The kids suddenly become quiet. Bartlet takes a moment to respond.

BARTLET
Okay. Send some flowers. Then I’ll call his parents. 

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
Okay. [looks at Charlie once more, then returns to the group of waiting children]
All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please 
bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England.

KIDS
No!

BARTLET
Oh, what was it again?

KIDS
America!

BARTLET
Yes.
 
FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Sam is standing in the hallway reading some papers, when C.J. rounds the corner and 
approaches. They talk on the way through the hallway to their offices.

SAM
Hey.

C.J.
Hey. 

SAM
Saw your briefing.

C.J.
What’d I do?

SAM
I’m not sure I’d put my foot on the gas so hard with hate crimes legislation.

C.J.
First of all, I barely grazed the gas. Second of all, why not?

SAM
Because we’re not sure where we stand on this.

C.J.
I know where I stand on this.

SAM
Congratulations, but the rest of us... 

C.J.
They threw rocks at his head.

SAM
I understand, but I’m just saying... 

C.J.
Ah. I’ll keep my food off the gas.

SAM
Thank you.

C.J.
What’s your secret service code name?

SAM
They just changed them.

C.J.
I know, what’s yours?

SAM
Princeton.

C.J.
Mine’s Flamingo.

SAM
It’s nice.

C.J.
No. It’s not nice.

SAM
[stops walking] Flamingo is a nice looking bird.

C.J.
The flamingo is a ridiculous looking bird.

SAM
You’re not ridiculous looking.

C.J.
I know I’m not ridiculous looking.

SAM
Any way for me to get out of this conversation?

C.J.
I’m gonna go talk to someone.

SAM
Excellent.

C.J. leaves. Sam continues winding his way to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

BONNIE
Sam? How you doing?

SAM
I’m going to be in Bermuda in 27 hours, that’s how I’m doing. Where’s Toby?

GINGER
He said he had to run out of the office.

JOSH
[enters] Sam?

SAM
Hey.

JOSH
You got a sec?

SAM
Yeah. 83 degrees in Bermuda.

GINGER
Sam. [hands him some messages]

SAM
Just me, some sun tan oil and 655 pages of briefing memos.

They walk inside SAM'S OFFICE. Josh closes the door.

JOSH
I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about your friend.

SAM
What happened?

JOSH
Nothing, listen...  you would describe her as, I’m sorry, what was her name again?

SAM
Laurie.

JOSH
She’s expensive?

SAM
Josh, I assure you, I would have no way of knowing...
  
JOSH
I understand, but...

SAM
Yes.

JOSH
Yeah?

SAM
Very expensive.

JOSH
She’s elite?

SAM
Yes. Why are we talking about this?

JOSH
Sam, I need to know if she would divulge the name or names of any influential Republican 
members of congress that she might have...
 
SAM
No way.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
I’m telling you no way, Josh.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Josh!

JOSH
There’s a thing that’s gonna happen.

SAM
What?

JOSH
Lillienfield knows that Leo’s a recovering alcoholic. 

SAM
Everyone knows that Leo is a recovering alcoholic. 

JOSH
Yeah, but they don’t know that there were pills. There was Valium. He was in rehab.

SAM
When?

JOSH
Six years ago.

SAM
He was Secretary of Labor six years ago.

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
He was high when he was running the Labor Department. 

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
And Lillienfield knows this?

JOSH
I’m fairly sure that’s why he started this in the first place. Lillienfield’s going hunting.
[beat] Sam, we owe Leo everything. I mean everything.

SAM
I’ll call her, and we’ll go see her together.

JOSH
Thanks.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Charlie is exiting the Oval Office with some files. Mrs. Landingham enters.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes, ma’am.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It’s important you remind the President throughout the day that he’s allergic to eggnog.

CHARLIE
Sure.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Thank you.

She sits at her desk and begins to work on the computer. Charlie leans on his desk and 
watches her. A staffer walks through with big holiday decorations. The entire room is 
full of red ribbons, wreaths, and such.

CHARLIE
This place looks great doesn’t it?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
I’ve never seen a Christmas look like this, the trees, and the lights, and everybody singing.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
The presents... 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
I brought it up because, I don’t know, you seem a little down this week.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah, I know Charlie. I tend to get a little down during he holidays.

CHARLIE
You don’t like Christmas?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I miss my boys.

CHARLIE
I never knew you had kids.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Twins. Andrew and Simon. I tried not, you know, I dressed them differently, but they 
still did everything together. They went off to medical school together, and then they 
finished their second year at the same time, and of course their lottery number came up 
at the same time.

CHARLIE
For the draft?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Well I would have thought they could get a deferment to finish med school.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
They didn’t want one. Their father and I begged them, but they wanted to go where people 
needed doctors. Their father and I begged them, but you can’t tell kids anything. So they 
joined up as medics and four months later hey were pinned down during a fight in DaNang 
and were killed by enemy fire. That was Christmas Eve 1970. 
[beat] You know, they were so young, Charlie, they were your age. It’s hard when that 
happens so far away, you know because, with the noises and the shooting, they had to be 
so scared. It’s hard not to think that right then they needed their mother... Anyway, 
I miss my boys.

She looks up for a moment, then back to some papers on her desk.
  
CHARLIE
[softly] Okay. 

Charlie walks away as Mrs. Landingham continues to work on the papers, trying to put 
thoughts of her boys out of her head.

CUT TO: EXT. KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL - DAY
Toby is looking at the Korean War Memorial, and then glances to the park bench where the 
homeless veteran died. He walks up to a stand with information about the Korean War and 
it’s veterans. 

STAND WORKER
What to sign the book?

TOBY
Excuse me?

STAND WORKER
Sign the book?

TOBY
Sure.

STAND WORKER
Ah, you looking for anything in particular? 

TOBY
No. No. Just... I’m not a visitor. I was, uh... I’m not the police. I was... [beat] 
A homeless man died this morning near the monument. [gestures to the park bench]

STAND WORKER
Yeah, when the weather gets down... 

TOBY
Occurred to me that maybe he slept there a lot, maybe you knew him.

STAND WORKER
Yeah, he was one of them. Was he a friend of yours?

TOBY
No.

STAND WORKER
I didn’t think so.

TOBY
I’m just trying to contact someone that might, you know, be interested that he died.

STAND WORKER
They usually hang out around Capital and “P,” I’d try there.

TOBY
Thanks. [starts to walk away, but turns back] You a veteran?

STAND WORKER
Yeah.

TOBY
[offers his hand] Toby Zeigler.

STAND WORKER
John Noonan. [They shake hands.]

TOBY
Merry Christmas.

STAND WORKER
Merry Christmas.

John Noonan watches thoughtfully as Toby walks away.

CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and Mandy are arguing while Charlie and a few Secret Service Agents stand by. 
Bartlet is putting on his coat as if he is getting ready to leave.

MANDY
A couple of guys.

BARTLET
No.

MANDY
Mr. President a couple of guys.

BARTLET
Leave me alone.

JOSH
[enters] Good morning Mr. President.

BARTLET
Josh, what are you doing right now?

JOSH
I’m helping prepare a strategy for the European economic summit in February.

BARTLET
Blow it off.

JOSH
[flippant] Okay.

BARTLET
Seriously, take an hour and come with us.

JOSH
You’re going shopping?

MANDY
He won’t let me send some press along.

BARTLET
Leave me alone.

JOSH
I don’t understand. How are you going shopping?

BARTLET
Oh I sneak out every now and then.

JOSH
You sneak out?

BARTLET
Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear 
the store, I’m in, I’m out. It’s like nothing ever happened.

JOSH
I never knew this.

BARTLET
Did you know that there’s an underground tunnel out of here?

JOSH
Yes.

BARTLET
I haven’t been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.

JOSH
Where are you going?

BARTLET
To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?

JOSH
Fishing tackle?

BARTLET
Funny boy.

MANDY
The President is doing some last minute Christmas shopping at a rare bookstore and he 
won’t let me send some press along.

BARTLET
Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!

MANDY
A couple of guys.

BARTLET
This is a Christmas thing I’m doing Mandy; we don’t have to make hay out of it.

MANDY
It’s such good hay.

BARTLET
[to Josh] Want to come?

JOSH
An hour with you in a rare bookstore? Couldn’t you just drop me off the top of the 
Washington monument instead?

BARTLET
It’s Christmas, Josh! No reason we can’t do both. 

JOSH
I suppose.

BARTLET
Let’s go shopping!

The group exits the Oval Office.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. is talking to a staffer and handing her some papers. Danny approaches and follows 
C.J. as she starts to walk to her office.

STAFFER
Okay, I got it.

DANNY
Hey C.J.

C.J.
Hello Danny.

DANNY
I saw the black suburban in back. President’s slipping away, huh?

C.J.
He suddenly realized he’d forgotten to get you a Christmas gift.

DANNY
How sweet.

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
So, I’ve put together a list.

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
Of reasons why you should go out with me.

C.J.
Really?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Well I’ll tell you what, give me a couple of hours to put together a list of reasons 
why I shouldn’t, then we’ll compare them and see where we are. [stops to face him]
My secret service code name is Flamingo. 

DANNY
Nice bird.

C.J.
Go away.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. watches Danny as he walks away and doesn’t hear Sam pass by. She follows as she sees him.

SAM
Hey.

C.J.
Sam?

SAM
Yup?

C.J.
What do you and Josh have going on tonight?

SAM
[nervously] Nothing.

C.J.
I just meant did you want to come over for dinner.

SAM
Oh, yeah.

C.J.
What did you think I meant?

SAM
I’m going to Bermuda tonight.

C.J.
Okay. Yeah, that’s right.

SAM
What?

C.J.
What did you think I meant?

SAM
It’s what I thought you meant.

C.J.
Then why did you say nothing if you are going to Bermuda tonight?

SAM
I really don’t know.

C.J.
Okay.

SAM
But thank you for the invitation.

C.J.
Okay. Sam. [stops] What have you and Josh have going on tonight?

SAM
Nothing. [quickly leaves]

CUT TO: INT. RARE BOOKS STORE - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are skimming through the bookshelves in an aisle. Bartlet suddenly 
stops and grabs a book and begins to examine it.

BARTLET
Oooh! “The Fables of Phaedrus,” 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering, 
engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom 
by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse.

LEO
Well, nothing says Christmas like animal fables in iambic verse.

BARTLET
That’s what I say.

Mandy and Josh are in the next aisle.

MANDY
A few photographers would have killed him?

JOSH
Let it go.

MANDY
I’m just saying.

JOSH
Ah. Here’s one. [grabs a book from the shelf to look at]

MANDY
One what?

JOSH
A book which if I was stuck with it on a desert island, I still wouldn’t read it, 
“The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California.” 
I believe I would eat this book before I read it.

Bartlet and Leo pass Josh and Mandy and walk to another aisle.

BARTLET
So, you won’t change your mind?

LEO
Nope. I appreciate it, but... 

BARTLET
So you’re gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?

LEO
I’ve got plenty to do at the office.

BARTLET
Oh! So you’re gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better.

LEO
Look... 

BARTLET
Come to Manchester, stay at the house.

LEO
Oh, so you could read aloud from “The Fables of Phaedrus”?

BARTLET
I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it.

LEO
I’ll be fine.

BARTLET
Suit yourself.

They are quiet for a moment. Leo comes closer and lowers his voice. Bartlet is examining 
a new book he has found.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
When you get back from the holiday I’m afraid we’ll have to start talking seriously 
about my situation.

BARTLET
I’m not worried about it Leo.

LEO
I know you’re not, but that doesn’t... 

BARTLET
It’ll be fine, these things can go away by themselves.

LEO
No they can’t, sir, and they usually don’t. I’m gonna need an exit strategy that’ll 
cause the least embarrassment and turmoil during the Mendoza confirmation.

BARTLET
I don’t want to talk about an exit strategy.

LEO
Sir?!

BARTLET
I really don’t. It’s gonna be fine.

CHARLIE
[approaches] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

CHARLIE
It’s time.

BARTLET
All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about 
getting this for her. “The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the 
Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.”

Leo looks to Charlie with a disbelieving look.

CHARLIE
[deadpan] Well, I think she would like that better than a new stereo, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah. Because it’s got brown Moroccan spine labels.

CHARLIE
Why don’t you head for the car and I’ll pay for the books.

BARTLET
All right, thanks. [to the shop keepers] Thank you all, Merry Christmas! 

Bartlet walks away as Leo walks over to Josh.

LEO
You heard what I said before right?

JOSH
What?

LEO
In my office this morning?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Ok?

JOSH
Yeah.

Bartlet comes back with two more books in his hands and gives them to Leo.

BARTLET
“Life of Epicurus”, two volumes.

LEO
Let’s go.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. UNDERPASS OF WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT
Toby approaches a large group of homeless people in a soup line ran by volunteers. 
Toby is very uncomfortable and unsure of himself. He tries to get their attention.
 
TOBY
Excuse me. Ah, excuse me, I was wondering if by any chance you know a man named of 
Walter Hufnagle?

HOMELESS MAN
Walter?

TOBY
Yes.

HOMELESS MAN
You looking for Walter?

TOBY
I wasn’t looking for him. I was, uh...

HOMELESS MAN
There’s his brother down there. [points]

TOBY
Oh thank you. [starts to walk to the man that was pointed out]

HOMELESS MAN
What’s the problem?

TOBY
Oh, there’s no problem. Down on the end?

HOMELESS MAN
Yeah. Listen, he’s a little slow. I mean, he’s all right and everything. He’s just a 
little slow.

TOBY
Thanks. 

Toby walks under the bridge overpass, where dozens of homeless people are huddled around 
fires trying to keep warm. He approaches an older man, GEORGE HUFNAGLE. Like others, George
is sitting by a fire.

TOBY
Excuse me. Mr. Hufnagle?

GEORGE
I’m George.

TOBY
Are you, uh, Walter Hufnagle’s brother?

GEORGE
Yeah.

TOBY
I’m afraid I have some very bad news. Walter died last night.

GEORGE
Oh, jeez.

TOBY
It was a very cold night.

GEORGE
Yeah. ‘Cause of the North Easterly wind off the Chesapeake.

The homeless man that pointed George out to Toby approaches them.

HOMELESS MAN
Is everything all right?

GEORGE
Walter died.

HOMELESS MAN
Who are you?

TOBY
I’m, I’m... I’m Toby Zeigler. Uh, Walter was wearing my coat and it had my business card... 

HOMELESS MAN
You want your coat back?

TOBY
No.

GEORGE
The North Easterly wind off the Chesapeake.

TOBY
George, did you know your brother fought in Korea? 

GEORGE
Oh, I’m sure he didn’t mean nothing.

TOBY
No, no. Uh, he...
 
GEORGE
Sometimes people start things and they... 

TOBY
No, uh, he was in the Marines about forty-five years ago.

GEORGE
Yeah, I think I remember.

TOBY
He was given a medal.

GEORGE
Yeah?

TOBY
It’s called the Purple Heart. It’s for getting wounded in battle.

GEORGE
He was wounded?

TOBY
Yeah.

GEORGE
I guess he wasn’t too good at it, huh?

TOBY
No, no. Uh, a lot of people were wounded or even killed.

GEORGE
Were you there?

TOBY
No, no I was-- Anyway, uh, I wasn’t sure if anyone had, you know, contacted you.

GEORGE
I slept over there at the shelter last night because of the North Easterly wind off 
the Chesapeake.

TOBY
Yeah, it was -- it was pretty cold.

GEORGE
Yeah. And I guess there weren’t enough beds for Walter.

TOBY
Yeah. I’m sorry. Goodnight. [turns to walk away, but he can’t leave yet]
I’m, I’m sorry. This is absolutely none of my business. Your brother is entitled to a 
proper funeral with mourners and I think he deserves an honor guard, and you don’t know 
me, but I’m an in... I’m an influential person. [sighs in frustration with himself]
I’m a very powerful person. And I would like to arrange it.

GEORGE
A funeral?

TOBY
[turns to the other homeless man] Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

HOMELESS MAN
Yeah.

TOBY
[to George] So that if I come and pick you up in the morning and I’ll bring you back after.

HOMELESS MAN
I’ll make sure he’s here.

TOBY
Will you? [walks towards the homeless man] Thank you. Thank you. Let me just, uh...
[reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of bills and gives them all to the homeless
man for him and George] Here... uh... please just take it. [starts to walk away quickly]

HOMELESS MAN
Nah man, that’s all your money.

TOBY
That’s ok, thank you.

HOMELESS MAN
No, you don’t live around here.

TOBY
No.

HOMELESS MAN
You gonna need it for the bus.

TOBY
I’m fine. Thanks.

HOMELESS MAN
Here. Take it. [hands the money back]

TOBY
Really. I’m fine.

HOMELESS MAN
You don’t live around here.

TOBY
Thanks. [takes the money and quickly leaves]

C.J. is leaning against her desk reading a list to Danny who is sitting in a chair 
listening in amusement.
 
C.J.
You are a reporter. I’m The Press Secretary. It’s an unavoidable conflict of interest. 
It would hurt my reputation. It would hurt your reputation. Your editors would obviously... 

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
What are you doing?

C.J.
I’m reading you my list.

DANNY
You really made a list?

C.J.
Didn’t you?

DANNY
Sure.

C.J.
You didn’t make a list.

DANNY
I made a list, got it right here.

C.J.
You said you made a list.

DANNY
I made a mental list.

C.J.
Well, I made an actual list.

DANNY
I can see.

C.J.
What did you come in here for?

DANNY
To give you your Christmas present.

He stands up and reaches into his coat pocket to produce a small cylinder shaped gift.

C.J.
You already gave me a goldfish Danny, what more could a girl possible want? 

He watches as she rips into the wrapping paper to reveal--

C.J.
Goldfish food.

DANNY
I’m gonna ignore your list ‘cause I think it’s ridiculous. Also ‘cause I got a crush on you.

CAROL
[stands in the doorway] C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

CAROL
Leo’s here?

Danny grabs his coat and heads for the door as Leo enters.

DANNY
See you later.

LEO
Hey Danny.

DANNY
Hey Leo.

LEO
That’s a nice goldfish.

DANNY
Isn’t it?

LEO
Happy Holidays.

DANNY
You too. [leaves]

LEO
C.J.

C.J.
I’m rebuffing his advances, Leo.

LEO
Whatever. Listen, dial down the rhetoric on hate crimes would you?

C.J.
You told me to float a test balloon.

LEO
Float it. Don’t shove it down anyone’s throat. I don’t know which way we’re gonna come 
down on this one.

C.J.
They made him say “Hail Mary’s” as they beat him to death. This was a crime of entertainment.

LEO
C.J.... 

C.J.
Beyond the crime itself is a manifestation of racism, or sexism, or anti Semitism or 
homophobia that are only a tip of the iceberg of the pathology troubling this country.

LEO
I’m aware of all that. I’m just not sure it’s right to legislate against how someone thinks. 
A lot of people aren’t sure, a lot of ‘em work here and I’m telling ya’ to dial it down.

C.J.
Okay.

LEO
Thank you.

C.J.
[sits] You have plans yet?

LEO
For Christmas?

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
My plan is to do nothing.

C.J.
Want me to come cook you something?

C.J.
I was just asking.

Hi.

LAURIE
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

The mood in the room is tense.

SAM
This is Josh Lyman.

LAURIE
Hi. 

JOSH
Hi.

LAURIE
Come in.

Sam and Josh walk into the front room and Laurie closes the door behind them. Sam and Josh 
look somewhat nervous and apprehensive.

SAM
Hi.

LAURIE
Well, like I said on the phone, I only have a few minutes.

SAM
Right, we’ll get right to the point.

LAURIE
Please.

SAM
Right. Here’s what’s going on. A guy we work with is in some trouble. We believe a 
congressman is about to expose something about his past that’s gonna be damaging to him. 
And doing what you do in the universe in which you do it, we though that maybe... 

Laurie walks around Sam, upset with what he is proposing.

LAURIE
I could give you a name of an influential Republican who likes to have kinky sex so 
that you could scare Lillienfield into shutting up?

SAM
I never said that it was Lillienfield.

LAURIE
Is it Lillienfield?

SAM
Yes.

LAURIE
This is for real? This isn’t a joke of some kind? 

SAM
This is for real.

LAURIE
[beat] Then get out and we’ll pretend that this never happened.

JOSH
Hey, haven’t we met?

LAURIE
Yes we have.

JOSH
Where?

SAM
White House. She came to the state dinner with Carl Everett.

LAURIE
Who raised about five million dollars in the mid-west for Bartlet. Did you think that 
only Republicans pay for sex? 

SAM
Laurie, this really isn’t about... 

LAURIE
I can’t believe you. What, did you get this out of a book?

JOSH
It was my idea.

LAURIE
Oh! What are you, the brains of the outfit?

JOSH
[voice rising] Yeah, I am. And I got to tell you, I could care less about your indignation 
right now. A man has left himself open to the kind of attack from which men in my business 
don't recover. Now if our tactics seem less than civilized it’s because so are our attackers 
and in any event I don’t feel like standing here taking a civics lesson from a hooker!

SAM
Josh!

JOSH
We don’t need your cooperation, Laurie, one of your guys wrote you a check and the I.R.S. 
works for me.

LAURIE
Get the hell out of my house.

JOSH
Just give me a name. What do you want? Money? I’ll give you money!

LAURIE
Oh fine, I’ll give you a name, and then I’ll hope back into the shower and you can leave 
the money on the nightstand. How ‘bout that?

SAM
I don’t think he meant--

LAURIE
Yes, he did!

JOSH
No, I didn’t. [turns away in frustration, then turns back to Laurie]
In fact I’m sorry. I apologize. That was very rude.

SAM
We wouldn’t have asked Laurie, but this person means a lot to us.

LAURIE
You’re the good guys. You should act like it.

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24
Leo is sitting at his desk and is talking to C.J. about hate crimes legislation. 
Margaret walks in with more Christmas presents and cards for Leo to sign.
 
C.J.
Yeah, but we’re not just talking about burning a cross on someone’s lawn. People are 
getting killed.

LEO
And people get punished for committing that crime. Do you also want to start punishing 
them for what’s in their mind when they commit it?

C.J.
Yes.

LEO
Really?

C.J.
Yes.

Leo looks disdainfully at the card Margaret hands to him.

LEO
Who is this?

MARGARET
[reading a tag on the present] Elizabeth.

LEO
Who’s Elizabeth?

MARGARET
[checks her clipboard] Your sister.

C.J.
I’m saying this is an abstract theory. It’s not enough to say we’re protecting people’s 
civil rights; we have to actually do it. Plus it has the added benefit of being good politics.

LEO
Ah, see? Now I’m listening.

C.J.
We’ll get into it after the break?

LEO
We’ll get into it after the break.

JOSH
[enters with Sam] Excuse me.

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
You wanted to see us?

Leo stands from his chair and Margaret packs up the gifts to leave.

LEO
Oh yes, very much.

C.J.
I should leave?

LEO
As quickly as possible. 

C.J. and Margaret exit the office, while Leo looks at Josh and Sam.

LEO
You went and did it?

JOSH
What?

LEO
Exactly what I asked you not to do.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
You went and saw Sam’s friend?

SAM
How’d you know?

LEO
I had you tailed.

JOSH
You had us tailed?

LEO
Yes.

SAM
Why did you have us tailed?

LEO
On the off chance that you’re as stupid as you look. Whose idea was this?

JOSH
It was mine. Sam was a reluctant accomplice. You had us tailed?

LEO
Get over it.

SAM
She didn’t give us anything.

LEO
I should hope not.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
It’s not what we do, Josh.

SAM
That maybe true, but still... 

LEO
It’s not what we do.

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
You should apologize to that girl for even asking. 

SAM
I did.

LEO
Then apologize again.

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
Like I’m not gonna have enough problems without the Keystone Cops.

JOSH
We meant well.

LEO
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

JOSH
No.

LEO
[beat] Well, it does.

JOSH
I’m glad.

LEO
Go back to work.

SAM
It’s Christmas Eve.

LEO
What, the country isn’t open Christmas Eve?

SAM
Fair point. [leaves]

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
I know.

JOSH
It’s gonna get bad before it gets better.

LEO
I know. [beat] Margaret! Lets get this over with.

JOSH
I’m here Christmas.

LEO
Okay.
 
Josh leaves and Margaret comes back with an armload of brightly wrapped Christmas 
presents. Leo just looks at them in unpleasant surprise.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is giving a briefing to the White House Press Corps.

C.J.
There’s been no change with the Presidents departure time of 10 a.m. so we’re still 
looking at about noon. This is a half day for us, so I’m gonna make it a half day for 
you too. There is no more news from The White House. The lid is on. Have a Merry Christmas. 

REPORTERS
Merry Christmas.

C.J. starts to walk back to her office, grabbing Danny on the way.

C.J.
Hey, Fishboy. 

C.J. continues to walk, while Danny hurries to follow.

C.J.
Answer me this, and when you do bear in mind there’s a lot riding on it.

DANNY
On what?

C.J.
Your answer.

DANNY
What’s riding on it?

C.J.
[turns quickly and stops] A date with me.

DANNY
Fire.

C.J.
Don’t you think imposing additional penalties for hate-motivated crimes is a powerful 
statement by society against tolerance?

DANNY
No. A crime is a crime. One murder isn’t any better or worse than another.

C.J.
Boy, was that the wrong answer.

DANNY
Punishing people for their beliefs is, the beginning of the end. Once more you agree 
with me.

C.J.
I don’t agree with you.

DANNY
Ok.

C.J.
Take me out tonight and convince me.

DANNY
Excuse me?

C.J.
You heard me.

DANNY
I didn’t, ‘cause there was -- I was distracted by a thing.

C.J.
I’m not gonna say it again.

DANNY
Ok, then I’m gonna assume that you asked me out. [walks away]

C.J.
[quickly follows] I didn’t ask you out. You asked me out about forty-nine times and I’m 
saying yes to one of them.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
You understand we’re having dinner right?

DANNY
I understand.

C.J.
We’re not having a fling.

DANNY
I understand.

C.J.
This is a business dinner, in fact bring your notebook. 

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
[stops] My secret service name is Flamingo.

DANNY
That’s nice.

C.J.
I have to feed my fish.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. walks into her office leaving Danny in wonderment at what just happened. Josh 
is standing by the bullpen.

JOSH
Hey Danny.

DANNY
Hey Josh.

JOSH
How’s it going?

DANNY
Hard to say.

JOSH
Okay.

DANNY
Okay.

Danny walks away as the camera moves to Donna, who is sitting at her desk opening her 
Christmas gift from Josh. He watches on as she reveals a book.

DONNA
"Heimlich Beckengruber on The Art and Artistry of Alpine Skiing."

JOSH
It’s got a molted calf cover and original drab boards.

DONNA
I don’t know what to say.

JOSH
I wrote a note inside. 

Donna opens the book and begins to read what Josh has written. She is obviously 
affected by his words.

JOSH
Donna, don’t get emotional. Donna, don’t get... let’s try and maintain some kind of... 

He’s looking around the bullpen embarrassed. Oblivious to his concerns of propriety, 
Donna closes the book, stands up, and approaches Josh.

DONNA
[tearfully] You see!? You spend most of our time being, you know, you. Then you write 
something like this to me. Thank you.

She pulls him into a tight hug. Josh, forgetting impropriety, hugs her back.

JOSH
I meant it.

DONNA
Skis would have killed you?

JOSH
[pulls back] Yeah.

DONNA
Okay.
 
Josh walks away to his office. He stops in his doorway to look back to her. Donna is 
back at her desk, re-reading his note, smiling.

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - DAY
A crowd of people applauds as Bartlet enters the room. A children’s choir is arranged 
at one side of the room.

BARTLET
Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House. [sees a young boy and shakes his hand]
Joey. Welcome to the White House.

The camera moves to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE as Toby enters.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning Toby.

TOBY
Good morning Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President would like to see you.

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Did you use his name to arrange a military funeral for a homeless veteran?

TOBY
Yes.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You shouldn’t have done that Toby.

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You absolutely should not have done that. 

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President is in the Mural Room.

TOBY
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The boys’ choir starts to sing “Little Drummer Boy” as Bartlet and the rest of the 
crowd listens. Mandy is standing next to Bartlet.

MANDY
[whispering] How would it be if I just mentioned... 

BARTLET
[under breath] No.

MANDY
Christmas shopping on your own at a bookstore?

BARTLET
Deal with it. 

BARTLET
[spots Toby by the door, to Mandy] I’ll be right back.

He and Toby leave the Mural Room and walk to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Nancy greets them.

NANCY
Merry Christmas Mr. President.

BARTLET
Merry Christmas, Nancy. 

Bartlet and Toby enter THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Hi.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How you doing?

TOBY 
I’m fine. Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Apparently I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.

TOBY
Yes, sir, I’m sorry, I... 

BARTLET
No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO, right?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What’s going on?

TOBY
A homeless man died last night, a Korean War Veteran, who was wearing a coat I had gave 
to the Goodwill. It had my card in it.

BARTLET
Toby, you’re not responsible... 

TOBY
An hour and twenty minutes for the ambulance to get there. A Lance Corporal, United 
States Marine Corps, Second of the Seventh. The guy got better treatment at Panmunjong.

BARTLET
Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran 
would come out of the woodworks? 

TOBY
I can only hope, sir.

BARTLET
[beat] When is this thing?

TOBY
I’m going to pick up his brother and go there now. 

MANDY
[appears by the doorway] Mr. President, sir? Your absence in the other room is conspicuous.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet looks at Toby once more and then pats him on the shoulder. He follows Mandy back 
to the Mural Room. Toby leaves the Oval Office and is about to leave for the funeral. 
He passes Mrs. Landingham on the way. She is putting on her coat and hat to go outside.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Toby, I’d like to come along. 

He gestures for her to join him.

The episode ends with a montage of juxtaposing shots of the military funeral for 
Walter Hufnagle and the activity in THE MURAL ROOM. Throughout, we can hear the boys’ 
choir sing “Little Drummer Boy.”

The hearse arrives at ARLINGTON CEMETERY, SECTION 43. Toby, Mrs. Landingham, and George 
get out of the car. George is holding a bouquet of flowers. The honor guard carries the 
casket to the grave. They begin the ritual of folding the flag that covered the casket.

THE MURAL ROOM. Sam and C.J. join Mandy and Bartlet. Then, Charlie and Leo join.

ARLINGTON CEMETERY. The honor guard starts to shoot their rifles in salute. Toby flinches 
with the first shot. Mrs. Landingham with the second.

THE MURAL ROOM. Donna and Josh join the group.

ARLINGTON CEMETERY. The honor guard starts to hand the tightly folded flag to Toby who 
gestures uncomfortably to George, who is then presented with the flag. George gently 
places the flowers on the casket. They all stand to leave.

FADE OUT.

West Wing S01E11
The Kashmir border powderkeg becomes more explosive when the Indian army invades Pakistani-held territory, making the threat of a nuclear confrontation frighteningly real to President Bartlet (Martin Sheen), who calls in Lord Marbury (Roger Rees), an eccentric British diplomat with ties to both warring nations -- and a weakness for booze. An angry Josh (Bradley Whitford) is subpoenaed to testify as the investigation into substance abuse among White House staffers grinds on towards its inevitable target: chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer). Mandy (Moira Kelly) floats a trial balloon among the staff to test their reaction to her notion of representing a liberal Republican. The President is surprised when Charlie (Dul� Hill) asks him if he can date his willing daughter Zoey (Elisabeth Moss).

Another officer, JACK, comes over to look at the screen.

OFFICER [cont.]
Last pass with the CAGE satellite.

JACK
How old is this?

OFFICER
About twenty minutes.

JACK
Go to X-10 inside the grid.

OFFICER
[zooms in on a section of the grid] Those are two CVEs and four destroyers.

JACK
Let’s get some help.

CUT TO: INT. THE PENTAGON - NIGHT
Two men, one in uniform and one not, are talking. Another uniformed officer enters.
 
ARMY GUY 1
[entering] So far we can identify elements of the Northern, Central, and Western command 
armies. They all appear to be front-line divisions. We’re working up divisional ID.

ARMY GUY 2
What about the navy?

ARMY GUY 1
We’re getting e-lint. Two CVEs, four destroyers -

ARMY GUY 2
Where they heading?

ARMY GUY 1
Pakistan.

ARMY GUY 3
I’m sold. Let’s brief the COs.

ARMY GUY 2
I’ll get on the phone with the White House.

He goes to the phone and starts dialing as the other two leave.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Josh and Donna leave his office and walk down the hallway.

JOSH
You’ll like it.

DONNA
It doesn’t sound like I’ll like it.

JOSH
Caddying?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
It’s great!

DONNA
Don’t I just lug your golf clubs around?

JOSH
Well, it’s good exercise.

DONNA
Of course it’s good exercise, I’m lugging your golf clubs around.

JOSH
You’ll be doing more than that, Donna. You’ll be reading the greens, you’ll be helping 
with club selection.

WHITE HOUSE GUARD [OS]
Here he is now.

JOSH
Who, me?

They turn to the NORTHWEST LOBBY.

SUBPOENA MAN
Joshua Lyman?

JOSH
Oh, man.

SUBPOENA MAN
Are you Joshua Lyman?

JOSH
Is this Claypool again?

SUBPOENA MAN
Mr. Lyman, you’re being served with a subpoena to give deposi...

JOSH
[to guard] Why do you let him in the building?

SUBPOENA MAN
Sir, if you’ll just sign as to show proof of-

JOSH
Gimme that. [signing the paper on Donna’s back] 
This is like the 43rd time -- This is Freedom Watch, right?

SUBPOENA MAN
Yes sir.

JOSH
Yeah, you guys are real patriots.

SUBPOENA MAN
I hope this hasn’t inconvenienced you too much.

JOSH
[handing back the signed paper] Being subpoenaed? No. Why would that inconvenience me?

SUBPOENA MAN
[as he leaves] Have a good day, sir.

JOSH
Thank you. Drop dead. [to Donna] It’s what I do now. I’m a professional hostile witness. 

DONNA
Would I get to drive the cart?

They go through a door into a HALLWAY.

JOSH
No carts.

DONNA
You don’t use a cart?

JOSH
No. Real golfers don’t use carts.

DONNA
Don’t they also carry their own clubs?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Would you pay me extra? 

JOSH
No.

DONNA
You play in the winter?

JOSH
I would wait until spring, but I’d want you to start practicing with that bag right away.

Donna stops, then veers off. Josh turns to walk into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. 
Mrs. Landingham is at her desk when Josh enters.
 
JOSH
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How are you, Josh?

JOSH
I’ve been subpoenaed.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I’m sorry, dear. Would you like a cookie?

JOSH
[taking one] Yes, thanks. The President asked me to come by.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President just left with Leo.

JOSH
Where’d they go?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The Situation Room.

Josh puts the cookie back in the jar and walks out.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Military and Intelligence staff are seated around the table. They all start to rise as 
Bartlet and Leo enter.

BARTLET
Keep your seats. [beat, they all sit] Admiral Fitzwallace?

Admiral Fitzwallace comes to the table, passing a staffer who is setting a clock to 
Kashmir time.

FITZWALLACE
[sits] Mr. President, twenty-five minutes ago, the Indian army launched an invasion 
along the Kashmir cease-fire line, into Pakistan-held Kashmir territory.

BARTLET
Is it clear what India’s objective is?

FITZWALLACE
No sir.

BARTLET
When you say “the Indian army,” what are we talking about?

FITZWALLACE
Sir?

BARTLET
Five guys in a Humvee? What?

FITZWALLACE
Mitch?

MITCH
Sir, they committed the 4th motorized infantry division, the 9th and 26th infantry 
divisions, and two other armored brigades, as well as four CVEs and two destroyers.

Bartlet is now reading from a paper that’s been handed to him.

LEO
All told?

FITZWALLACE
Approximately 300,000 troops, sir.

BARTLET
[looking up] In the last twenty-five minutes?

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
This was long planned.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
All I’m trying to do right now? I’m trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.

CIA DIRECTOR
Mr. President...

BARTLET
300,000 troops? I can’t move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing 
up on a weather satellite.

CIA DIRECTOR
We dropped the ball, Sir.

BARTLET
Pick it up again, would you please?

CIA DIRECTOR
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Any chance this is an exercise?

FITZWALLACE
No sir.

BARTLET
A threat gesture?

FITZWALLACE
Possibly.

BARTLET
Any nuclear activity?

FITZWALLACE
We don’t know sir.

BARTLET
Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, that’s probably not important information.

CIA DIRECTOR
We’ve obviously ordered intense surveillance.

LEO
How intense?

CIA DIRECTOR
The nearest orbiting satellites have been diverted to the area. The KH Super Platform 
has been tasked into stationary orbit over the Northern subcontinent.

LEO
How long till it’s on station?

FITZWALLACE
Six hours, sir.

BARTLET
All right. I’m ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to 
give me a national security briefing. Thank you.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Toby and Sam are walking quickly along the outside corridor toward the President’s office.

SAM
What’s the ambassador’s name?

TOBY
Which ambassador?

SAM
The Pakistani ambassador.

TOBY
You’re saying our guy in Pakistan, or their guy here?

SAM
Our guy in Pakistan.

TOBY
We haven’t appointed one yet.

SAM
You’re kidding.

They go through the door into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

TOBY
[to Sam] Nope.

CHARLIE
Hey, Toby.

TOBY
Hey Charlie.

CHARLIE
Sam.

SAM
Charlie.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good evening, Sam. Good evening, Toby.

TOBY
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.

SAM
[to Toby] It’s been over a year.

TOBY
What are you talking to me for?

SAM
We have no one in Pakistan?

TOBY
That’s right.

SAM
Maybe that’s why they got invaded.

TOBY
Yeah.

They go into THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet, Josh and Leo are already present.

LEO
The Pakistanis have about 20,000 mountain terrain troops at the frontier command along 
the Northern front, and four divisions at the 10th corps along the Eastern front.

JOSH
All this happened without the CIA knowing about it?

BARTLET
I’ve already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency 
session to try to affect a cease-fire.

TOBY
Well, I feel better already, Mr. President.

SAM
How could we not have an ambassador in Pakistan?

BARTLET
We were getting to it.

TOBY
How could the CIA miss 300,000 armed people walking all over-

BARTLET
They didn’t exactly miss them. In fact, they’ve got a very good photo now.

TOBY
Yeah, but the idea is to spot them before they cross the border, right?

BARTLET
Yeah.

TOBY
Oops.

JOSH
For the moment we’re just talking about conventional weapons, right?

BARTLET
Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?

TOBY
I know that any war between these two countries that begins with conventional weapons 
isn’t gonna end that way.

LEO
Wanna take care of briefing the Hill?

JOSH
Yeah.
 
C.J.
[enters] Good evening.

BARTLET
Hello.

C.J.
I’m sorry. Charlie and Mrs. Landingham stepped away. Should I go back and wait in the...

LEO
Uh, no, we were just breaking up.

C.J.
Can I tell the room there’s a full lid?

LEO
Yeah. [looks at Bartlet, who nods]

C.J.
Okay. I’ll send ‘em home.

BARTLET
Thanks, C.J.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. [exits]

LEO
[to Toby] I’ll brief her in the morning.

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Charlie is typing at the computer. Zoey enters.

ZOEY
Hey, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Hey.

ZOEY
How ya doin’?

CHARLIE
[standing] Good. 

ZOEY
Is he in?

CHARLIE
I’ll tell him you’re here.

ZOEY
Nah, that’s okay.

CHARLIE
He’ll want to know you’re here.

ZOEY
I’ll just wait.

CHARLIE
Okay.

ZOEY
So, Charlie, do you ever get a night off?

CHARLIE
No, actually.

ZOEY
That’s too bad.

CHARLIE
No, it’s all right.

ZOEY
No, I meant ‘cause it’d be cool to go out or something.

CHARLIE
Yeah. [pause] I’m sorry, with me?

ZOEY
Charlie, you know you don’t have to stand up the whole time I’m in a room.

CHARLIE
Yeah. I don’t know why I do that. [sits]

Josh and Sam are coming out of the Oval Office.

JOSH
Hi Zoey.

BARTLET [OS]
Is that Zoey?

ZOEY
[to Charlie] Anyway, too bad.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

SAM
Zoey.

Sam and Josh leave, and Zoey goes into the Oval Office. Charlie looks thoughtful.

CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh and Sam are walking back to their offices.

JOSH
I’ve been subpoenaed. 

SAM
By Claypool? 

JOSH
Under the Freedom of Information Act. It’s reported that I was running the internal 
investigation after Lillienfield accused us all of being on drugs.

SAM
Well, not all of us, Josh. Just one in three.

JOSH
Right.

SAM
So Claypool’s suing you for the paperwork?

JOSH
I’m being deposed at lunch tomorrow.

SAM
Who you bringing?

JOSH
I’m not bringing anyone.

SAM
Josh.

JOSH
It’s a non-event.

SAM
You should bring a lawyer.

JOSH
I am a lawyer.

SAM
Yeah. Seriously, you should bring a real lawyer.

JOSH
Thanks for the pep talk.

SAM
No sweat.

MANDY
[catches up] Joshua.

JOSH
Madeline.

MANDY
What’s up?

JOSH
Not too much.

MANDY
We’re gonna look good in California.

JOSH
I’m gonna look pale.

MANDY
I meant the President.

JOSH
I know. I’m just sayin’. [goes into his office]

MANDY
Sam, could I talk to you for a second?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
In your office?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
Thanks.

They walk into SAM’S OFFICE.

SAM
What’s up?

MANDY
I’m thinking of taking on a new client and I think it might be a problem for Josh and 
Toby and I was hoping that maybe you could help smooth the way.

SAM
Who?

MANDY
Hmm?

SAM
Who’s the client?

MANDY
Mike Brace.

Sam starts to laugh.

MANDY 
Sam.

SAM
You’re serious?

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
Mike Brace is a Republican.

MANDY
You think I don’t know that?

SAM
You think Josh and Toby might have a problem with that?

MANDY
Sam, he’s moderate-to-liberal, he’s good on education, he’s good on women’s rights...

SAM
And he’s a Republican.

MANDY
He came to me.

SAM
That’s understandable.

MANDY
He sought me out.

SAM
You’re very good. We’d come to you too.

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
In fact, we did.

MANDY
Yes. And I’m coming to you now.

SAM
To get me to help you convince Josh and Toby to let you work for a Republican.

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
[sitting down at his desk] This is just my lucky day.

MANDY
Sam, I think you are the one senior guy here who is more interested in getting things 
done than beating the other...

SAM
That’s not true, Mandy. Josh and Toby are just as committed...

MANDY
Not lately. 

SAM
I disagree.

MANDY
The banking bill, the land-use rider, assault weapons? You like Mike Brace.

SAM
Mandy.

MANDY
I know.

SAM
This is going to be an impossible sell.

MANDY
It shouldn’t be.

SAM
But it will be.

MANDY
I know.

SAM
I admire your pluck.

MANDY
I’m sorry, what part of me do you admire?

SAM
Your pluck. Your gumption.

MANDY
Thank you.

SAM
You’re welcome.

MANDY
So you’re going to talk to Josh and Toby?

SAM
You’re gonna owe me a big favor.

MANDY
[going to the door] Sam.

SAM
All right, we’ll be even.

MANDY
Sam!

SAM
All right, I’ll do this and many more favors for you and we’ll be even.

MANDY
Thank you. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
Several reporters are present. C.J. enters and goes to the podium.

C.J.
Hi. We’re gonna have a briefing by the Treasury Department on the market adjustment...

REPORTER
Market adjustment?

C.J.
That’s what we’ve been asked to call it. That’s going to be nine tomorrow morning. 
With that, the lid is full, you can all go home.

REPORTERS
C.J.!

Toby has entered and is standing at the back of the room.

C.J.
Bruce?

BRUCE
I’ve got a source at the Pentagon who says in the last few hours there’s been massive 
troop movement on the Kashmir border.

C.J.
In the last few hours?

BRUCE
Yeah.

C.J.
I think you need to get a new source at the Pentagon, Bruce.

BRUCE
There’s nothing to it?

C.J.
What kind of troop movement?

BRUCE
Something like 300,000 troops and a few warships?

C.J.
300,000 troops?

BRUCE
Yeah.

C.J.
I think someone’s havin’ a little fun with you, Bruce.

BRUCE
You sure?

C.J.
I was just in the Oval Office ten minutes ago.

BRUCE
Okay.

C.J.
Have a good night, everybody.

The reporters exit. CLOSE UP on Toby.

CUT TO: EXT./EST. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Bartlet, Leo, and other Military and Intelligence staff are seated around the table. 
Fitzwallace is at the map projected on the wall.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, already intense fighting has occurred between Indian troops and Pakistani border 
garrisons. The cease-fire line’s been breached in two thrusts, with five divisions invading 
the area north of Kargil, and a two-corps-sized force that’s crossed west into Azhad.

BARTLET
Bobby?

BOBBY
In the past hour, Prime Minister Nohammed has spoken on television, saying that 
[reading from a paper] “after enduring endless provocations and incessant acts of 
thuggery by the criminal gang running Pakistan, India’s forbearance has been exhausted. 
In the name of peace, India is acting to put an end to Pakistan’s outlaw aggression once 
and for all.”

LEO
And Pakistan?

INTELLIGENCE GUY
They’re condemning India’s unlawful aggression and pledging all-out resistance.

BARTLET
Well, we’ve got ourselves a ballgame.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

LEO
When do we get the nuclear briefing?

INTELLIGENCE GUY
This afternoon, 1500.

BARTLET
3:00.

INTELLIGENCE GUY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Thank you.

They all rise and thank the President. 

CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Toby and Donna are walking down the hall.

DONNA
-- through the Freedom of Information Act.

TOBY
What kind of information are they looking for?

DONNA
He has information about the investigation.

TOBY
It wasn’t an investigation.

DONNA
I’m sure Josh’ll mention that.

TOBY
Did he bring a lawyer?

DONNA
Said he didn’t need one.

TOBY
Oh, good, I like the sound of this.

They arrive at LEO’S OFFICE. Donna turns off toward her office, Toby meets Margaret 
leaving the office.

TOBY
[to Margaret] Hello.

MARGARET
Leo’s coming and C.J.’s already inside.

TOBY
Thanks.

TOBY goes into LEO’S OFFICE.

C.J.
Hi. You know what this is about?

TOBY
Yeah. I stopped by your office before but...

C.J.
I was at the reception.

LEO
[arrives] Hi C.J.

C.J.
What’s going on?

LEO
India sent troops into the neutral zone in Kashmir. The U.N Security Council’s gonna 
try to negotiate a cease-fire, but we believe we’re gonna start to play a role in the 
next forty-eight to seventy-two hours. You can start to brief the press tonight, so 
I want you in on some of the meeting stuff today.

MARGARET
[enters] Leo...

LEO
[pointing across the hall] Oh, including this one.

C.J.
This happened last night?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
That’s what you all were talking about when I walked into the Oval Office?

LEO
I’m sorry, C.J., we...

C.J.
You told me the lid was on.

LEO
You’re gonna have to expect that sometimes.

C.J.
I got the question, Leo. A guy had a Pentagon source, I denied it. I called it ridiculous.

LEO
We know.

C.J.
Is it 300,000 troops?

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
A couple of destroyers?

TOBY
And four CVEs.

C.J.
The guy hit it right on the button. I made fun of him.

LEO
We’ll tell the room you spoke without knowing the facts.

C.J.
I guess that’s what I’ll do.

LEO
C.J.

C.J.
Don’t worry about it.

LEO
As soon as you tell ‘em India’s the story, this is forgotten.

C.J.
I’m fine. We’re across the hall?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J. exits. Leo and Toby share a look.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
Josh is seated across the table from CLAYPOOL. The deposition is being recorded on 
videotape with a live monitor. There are few other people in the room.

CLAYPOOL
Occupation?

JOSH
White House Deputy Chief of Staff.

CLAYPOOL
How long have you held this job?

JOSH
Since President Bartlet was sworn in, 12 months ago.

CLAYPOOL
Have you been conducting, over the past few weeks, an internal investigation into 
recreational drug use by White House staffers?

JOSH
I wouldn’t call it an investigation.

CLAYPOOL
Why not?

JOSH
It wasn’t that serious.

CLAYPOOL
You don’t consider illegal drug use at the White House to be serious?

JOSH
Whoa. Almost tripped me up in that clever web of words. No, I would consider drug use 
in the White House to be serious; I wouldn’t consider my investigation serious, and 
the way you know it wasn’t serious is that I was the one running it.

CLAYPOOL
What prompted the investigation?

JOSH
Congressman Lillienfield held a press conference in which he claimed that one in three 
White House staffers use drugs. I was asked to discover what, if anything, might have 
caused him to say that.

CLAYPOOL
Asked by whom?

JOSH
The Chief of Staff and the Communications Director.

CLAYPOOL
Leo McGarry and Toby Ziegler.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
As I’m sure you’re aware, the organization I represent is suing under the Freedom of 
Information Act for the records of your investigation.

JOSH
Yes, and I can save us all a lot of time by telling you that there are no records of 
my investigation. 

CLAYPOOL
Before being deposed here today, did you talk to anybody about the fact that we were 
requiring your testimony?

JOSH
I mentioned it to a few people.

CLAYPOOL
Who were they?

JOSH
Sam Seaborn.

CLAYPOOL
The Deputy Communications Director.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Why’d you mention it to him?

JOSH
No particular reason.

CLAYPOOL
No particular reason?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Really.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
You brought up the subpoena for no particular reason.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Who else?

JOSH
My assistant, Donna Moss.

CLAYPOOL
Well, what did you tell Mr. Seaborn and Miss Moss about this deposition?

JOSH
I told them that I had to waste a day on this deposition.

CLAYPOOL
What else did you tell them?

JOSH
I probably told them that I consider these moronic lawsuits of yours to be...

CLAYPOOL
Why do you persist in...?

JOSH
Because you have consistently acted not as someone determined to get the truth, but 
someone who hates President Bartlet, hates people who support President Bartlet, and 
is looking to make headlines and money. Now you have two hours today, and two hours 
tomorrow. Look, will somebody please offer me some coffee? 

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Larry and Ed are briefing Toby, C.J., and Sam.

LARRY
India’s population stands at roughly one billion. 82% are Hindus, 11% are Muslim.

ED
They’re mostly poor, but nearly as bad off as Pakistanis.

LARRY
Yes, whose average per capita income is $400.

ED
They are, however, better educated. Their literacy rate is 48%.

LARRY
And they’re healthier. Average lifespan is 57.7 years.

ED
The average rainfall...

TOBY
What the hell kind of briefing is this?

LARRY
Toby, if we could just have another hour to prepare...

TOBY
Where’d you get this stuff?

LARRY
I swear to God, the Encyclopedia Britannica.

C.J.
[rising to leave] I need a briefing.

TOBY
[as she leaves] C.J., we’re getting someone from State...

SAM
She’ll get over it.

TOBY
Yeah.

Toby and Sam rise to leave the room.

SAM
Listen. Let me ask you something without your head exploding?

TOBY
What?

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
What would your first reaction be to Mandy’s working for Mike Brace?

TOBY
What do you mean?

SAM
He came to her.

TOBY
She wants to work for Mike Brace?

SAM
She’s thinking about it.

They have arrived at the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good afternoon Toby, Sam.

SAM
Hey, Mrs. Landingham.

TOBY
Is this a joke?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You’re not going to say hello, Toby?

TOBY
Yes, hello. Is this a joke?

SAM
No.

TOBY
I don’t understand.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
I’m in disbelief.

SAM
What should I say your first reaction was?

TOBY
Disbelief.

SAM
He’s good on education, good on women’s rights.

TOBY
Are you shilling for her?

SAM
I’m not shilling. I’m just smoothing the way.

TOBY
Don’t do that.

SAM
She just asked me to take your temperature.

TOBY
And please don’t do that.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Toby and Sam enter. Bartlet and Leo are being briefed by Intelligence staff. 
There are several other people in the room.

JOE
India has two intermediate-range ballistic missiles named Agni 1 and Agni 2. Agni 
means ‘fire’ in Hindi. They have a 55-kiloton A-bomb which is roughly 50% more 
destructive than the Hiroshima bomb. But they also have a thermonuclear device.

LEO
An H-bomb.

JOE
Yeah.

TOBY
Joe, can you assess the command and control situation?

JOE
Well, this is the truly terrifying part.

TOBY
Good, ‘cause we were waiting for a truly terrifying part.

JOE
CCI systems are notoriously unreliable. They put their money in the weapons and ignore 
safeguards.

BARTLET
Like what?

JOE
Dual launch controls, clear chain of commands, satellite surveillance, mutual monitoring, 
exhaustive testing. Also, leaders are reluctant to share information for fear that it 
might weaken them. I’ll read this from a DOD overview. [reading] “At various times, both 
countries have displayed an incoherent decision-making system. You cannot predict what 
will happen in a crisis.”

BARTLET
Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we’re all set.

LEO
Thanks, Joe.

JOE
Sure.

Joe thanks the President and leaves with his staff.

BARTLET
There’s an India expert I want to bring in.

LEO
Who?

Bartlet looks at him pointedly.

LEO 
No.

BARTLET
You guys are gonna love him.

LEO
He’s a lunatic!

BARTLET
He’s colorful.

LEO
He’s certifiable!

SAM
Who?

BARTLET
Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James.

SAM
Where do we find him?

LEO
A psychiatric institution.

BARTLET
He’s colorful, Leo.

LEO
You’re really gonna let him loose in the White House, where there’s liquor and women?

BARTLET
We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.

LEO
Sir...

BARTLET
Let’s get him on a plane.

SAM
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Anything else?

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

They all rise. Sam and Toby leave the room.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Toby and Sam are walking back to their offices from the Oval Office.

SAM
Can I just say this about Mandy’s representing Mike Brace?

TOBY
No.

SAM
Okay.

TOBY
I feel like I should say something to C.J.

SAM
Don’t.

TOBY
You think?

SAM
It would be patronizing. If you don’t say anything, that’ll tell her that you think 
she’s a professional.

TOBY
I’m gonna go see her.

SAM
See what you do? You ask me my advice and then you ignore it.

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Okay. 

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is reviewing press releases.

C.J.
Carol?

CAROL
[enters] Yes?

C.J.
In the next few weeks, it’s going to be important that the White House reassure 
Americans and the world that the President has a firm grip on the crisis and is 
working hard to defuse it.

CAROL
Yes.

C.J.
They’re misspelling ‘New Delhi.’

CAROL
They put the ‘h’ in the wrong place?

C.J.
Hey, I’m happy when they use an ‘h’ at all.

CAROL
We’ll fix it.

TOBY
[arrives] Hey, Carol.

CAROL
[leaving] We’re fixing the ‘h.’

TOBY
Okay. [to C.J.] I was warned that coming to talk to you might be insulting to your 
professionalism.

C.J.
Well, you wouldn’t want to do that.

TOBY
I wasn’t ready for the press yet.

C.J.
Could've told me that before sending me in there.

TOBY
C.J.

C.J.
I flatly denied it. I said I was in the Oval Office ten minutes ago and nothing’s going on.

TOBY
They don’t think you lied to them.

C.J.
I know that. They think you lied to me, which is what happened. They don’t know me. 
I’m from nowhere. I was just starting to get credible. I was just starting to get 
their respect. You know how long it’s going to take me to get it back?

TOBY
There’s a concern.

C.J.
Don’t ask C.J., she doesn’t know anything.

TOBY
There is a concern that you’re too friendly with the press.

C.J.
Really.

TOBY
We know it’s important that you have a friendly relationship with them-

C.J.
It’s important for all of us.

TOBY
I don’t disagree.

C.J.
Does this have to do with Danny Concannon?

TOBY
People see you with Danny.

C.J.
This is outrageous.

TOBY
This is one time, and if we erred, it’s on the side of trying to-

C.J.
You sent me in there uninformed so that I’d lie to the press-

TOBY
We sent you in there uninformed because we thought there was a chance you couldn’t.

C.J.
Okay. I have all this work to do.

TOBY
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Toby is coming from C.J.’s office when he meets Josh returning to the office.

TOBY
Hey. How’d it go?

JOSH
It was fine.

TOBY
Got to go back tomorrow?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
Take a lawyer.

JOSH
You get 450 bucks an hour?

TOBY
No.

JOSH
Then mind your own business.

TOBY
Take Sam.

JOSH
It’s nothing. It’s this guy.

TOBY
Sam’s going with you.

JOSH
Oh, absolutely, ‘cause in the middle of an international crisis, what better place 
to put our resources?

TOBY
It’s two hours, just do it.

JOSH
C.J. pissed?

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is reading when Charlie enters.

CHARLIE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
The Chinese ambassador’s at the gate and he’ll be in the Mural Room in a moment.

BARTLET
This ought to be delightful.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thanks for staying late, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Mmm hmm. Mr. President, I was wondering if I could ask you a question.

BARTLET
Sure.

CHARLIE
I was wondering how you would feel about my going out on a date with Zoey.

BARTLET
I’m sorry?

CHARLIE
Well, Zoey was talking to me before, and she mentioned that if I had a free night-

BARTLET
My daughter asked you out?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
I should have locked her in the dungeon.

CHARLIE
I don’t think you’ve got one, sir.

BARTLET
I could have built one.

CHARLIE
Sir, if it’s not too much-

BARTLET
Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this.

LEO
[enters] I think he’s here.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir. [leaves]

BARTLET
Yes. [to Leo] He wants to go out with Zoey.

Leo starts to smile.

BARTLET
Shut up!

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
The CHINESE AMBASSADOR is in the room when Bartlet and Leo enter. They meet and shake hands.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Thank you. Good evening, Leo.

LEO
Good evening.

BARTLET
Please sit down.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Thank you.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and 
then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Mr. President, we have every hope for your success.

BARTLET
You do.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
However, I’ve been instructed by Beijing to inform you that under no circumstances 
will China allow India’s aggression against Kashmir, as it only intensifies the threat 
of Indian aggressors on our own border.

LEO
David? Are you suggesting that China might intervene?

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
The Indians must be stopped, Leo. Of course China would like to see a peaceful solution. 
But we are prepared to use whatever force is necessary.

BARTLET
Well, this just keeps getting better and better.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN: INT. OUTSIDE SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Mandy catches Sam as he’s leaving his office.

MANDY
Did you speak to him?

SAM
Toby?

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
I did.

MANDY
And?

SAM
Mandy, uh...

MANDY
He didn’t go for it.

SAM
It wasn’t the reaction you were hoping for.

MANDY
Did you tell him about education and women’s issues?

SAM
Yes.

MANDY
Did you tell him enthusiastically?

SAM
Yes.

MANDY
Did you tell him about...?

SAM
I told him everything there is to tell him. He did not warm to the idea.

JOSH
Let’s go.

SAM
I’m ready.

MANDY
Talk to him.

SAM
I will.

MANDY
Do it enthusiastically.

SAM
Okay.

JOSH
Talk to me about what?

SAM
Mandy wants to take on Mike Brace as a client.

JOSH
Is there another Mike Brace?

SAM
Not in the House of Representatives, no.

JOSH
She understands he’s a Republican right?

SAM
Yeah, she’s a pretty bright girl.

JOSH
Oh, I’m gonna kill her.

SAM
So you’re saying no way?

JOSH
Yeah, that’s a big 10-4.

SAM
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
The PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR is seated when Bartlet and Leo enter. There are two Pakistani
aides present as well.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Mr. President.

BARTLET
You know Leo McGarry?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Yes sir.

LEO
Good to see you again.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Terrible circumstances.

BARTLET
Please, sit down. We’ve been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck. 
Can you help us out there?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
The Prime Minister, naturally, is preoccupied organizing our response to this latest 
unprovoked aggression by India, but I’ll do my best to help you.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion 
by Indian forces.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
We felt your condemnation could have been stronger.

BARTLET
My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn’t feel that the 
Indian action was provoked.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
I think you’re being misinformed, Mr. President.

BARTLET
You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
The people of Kashmir are simply demanding their human rights guaranteed by the U.N. 
Charter for Self Determination. The unrest of the past few months is entirely the 
result of the cruel oppression of a defenseless people.

LEO
The people the President’s talking about aren’t defenseless, Mr. Ambassador. They’re 
carrying the M-16s we sold them.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Mr. McGarry...

BARTLET
Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
With all due respect, Mr. President, it is not a dispute, but an illegal occupation by 
the Indian state.

BARTLET
Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way 
for these two countries to exist together in a global community.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
That sounds very nice, Mr. President, but the people of Pakistan do not wish to exist 
in a global community with criminals.

BARTLET
I’d imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Be that as it may.

BARTLET
Yes. [standing] Thank you for coming.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[shaking hands with aides as they leave] Thank you.

CHARLIE
[enters] Mr. President?

BARTLET
I’ll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

Leo and Bartlet head across the hall to THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.

LEO
She’s a very outgoing girl.

BARTLET
See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that.

LEO
We learn these lessons the hard way.

BARTLET
I think you’re trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying this.

LEO
I’m not trying to cover it up at all.

BARTLET
I’m a father in pain.

LEO
Well, really you’re just a pain.

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
Got a racial problem?

BARTLET
A racial problem?

LEO
It’s okay to admit it.

BARTLET
I don’t!

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
I don’t have a racial problem.

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
I’m Spencer Tracy at the end of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
Racial problem!

LEO
I’m just saying...

BARTLET
My problem is not that she’s white, he’s black, it’s that she’s a girl and he’s not. 
To say nothing of he’s older than she is.

LEO
She’s 19. He’s 21.

BARTLET
Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years.

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
Tracy was good in that movie.

LEO
Yeah.

Charlie shows in the INDIAN AMBASSADOR.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Thank you.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
You look well, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire 
conditions without so much as a phone call, so let’s sit down and talk. Charlie, 
please close the door.

Charlie exits.

CUT TO: INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
Claypool is seated opposite Josh and Sam, continuing the deposition. There are 
several other people in the room.

CLAYPOOL
And you didn’t make a single note?

JOSH
No.

CLAYPOOL
You’re asking me to believe...

JOSH
This is the seventh lawsuit you’ve brought against the White House and the fourth time 
you’ve deposed me and demanded to see documents that don’t exist.

CLAYPOOL
In your investigation in which you wrote nothing down - and it’s nice to see that the 
White House is taking the matter so seriously - in your investigation did you find any 
evidence of staff drug use?

JOSH
No.

CLAYPOOL
I’d like to remind you that you’re under oath.

SAM
And I’d like to remind you that that’s the seventh time that you’ve reminded him since 
he sat down.

CLAYPOOL
Are there alcoholics working in the White House?

JOSH
I would imagine that there are.

CLAYPOOL
You would imagine?

JOSH
Statistics suggest...

CLAYPOOL
Do you know for sure that there are?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
What are their names?

JOSH
What, are you crazy?

CLAYPOOL
You don’t think the public has the right to know?

JOSH
Drinking isn’t against the law.

CLAYPOOL
I’m speaking of a higher standard.

SAM
He’s not going to tell you the names of people he knows to be alcoholics, move on.

CLAYPOOL
Is Leo McGarry an alcoholic?

JOSH
I won’t answer that.

CLAYPOOL
Has he received treatment at a facility for alcoholism?

JOSH
I won’t answer that.

CLAYPOOL
Has he received treatment at a facility for Valium addiction?

SAM
He’s not obligated to answer that question. 

CLAYPOOL
Why not?

SAM
It’s irrelevant to your cause of action under the Freedom of Information Act in which 
you are seeking any and all documents relating to Joshua Lyman’s investigation of 
illegal drug use in the White House. We go see the judge right now, she’ll sustain 
my objection.

CLAYPOOL
Mr. Lyman, in the course of your investigation, did you look at Secret Service files 
of the people you were investigating?

JOSH
There was no investigation.

CLAYPOOL
Did you look at any Secret Service files?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Including Leo McGarry’s?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Now, I have a record here which you would have had access to as well. It says...

JOSH
How did you get that?

CLAYPOOL
It says Leo McGarry spent twenty-eight days in an alcohol and substance abuse treatment 
center called Sierra Tucson.

JOSH
This is a piece of paper obtained illegally.

CLAYPOOL
That’s my problem. Your problem is to answer this question. In your investigation of 
Leo McGarry, did you discover that he was not only treated for alcohol addiction, he 
was treated for Valium addiction as well? Now, should we take that question to the 
judge and ask her about relevancy?

SAM
We’re going to postpone this deposition.

CLAYPOOL
I’m not nearly finished.

SAM
We’re postponing. You have a problem with it, cite us for contempt.

Sam and Josh rise to leave. Claypool rises and pursues them.

CLAYPOOL
I would think that you would be concerned with your own reputations. And the notion 
of you standing up for a man so egregiously unqualified...

Josh suddenly turns on Claypool and pushes him up against the wall. Sam quickly turns 
back into the room.

SAM
Josh!

Josh recovers himself.

SAM 
Go.

JOSH leaves the room.

SAM
[to Claypool] You’re a cheap hack. And if you come after Leo I’m gonna bust you like 
a piñata.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Leo, and the Indian ambassador are in mid-conversation.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Your frustration, Mr. President, is because you can no longer control us with the threat 
of economic sanctions.

BARTLET
My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons 
and a tendency to get cranky.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
India must and will be a nuclear power, Mr. President. That way, we’ll never be dictated 
to again.

BARTLET
Well, it was nice spending this time with you.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Thank you Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
[showing out the ambassador] Thank you.

BARTLET
Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him 
that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters.

LEO
Why don’t you?

BARTLET
I keep forgetting.

CHARLIE
[sticks his head in] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Is he here?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Send him in please.

LEO
Oh, God help me.

LORD JOHN MARBURY enters, looking disheveled.

BARTLET
John!

MARBURY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you for coming. How was your flight?

MARBURY
Intoxicating.

LEO
Oh, I see.

MARBURY
[to Leo] Allow me to present myself, Lord John Marbury, I was summoned by your President.

LEO
Yes. We’ve met, ten or twelve times. I’m Leo McGarry.

MARBURY
I thought you were the butler.

LEO
No, I’m the White House Chief of Staff.

MARBURY
Nonetheless, would you have something with which to light my cigarette?

LEO
Oh, I’m afraid we don’t allow smoking in this part of the world.

MARBURY
Really? 

LEO
Yes sir.

MARBURY
In this part over here, we encourage it.

LEO
Sir.

MARBURY
It’s “Your Lordship,” as a matter of fact, but it couldn’t possibly make the least 
difference. So, tell me, how can I be of service to you? If it’s within my power to 
give, you shall have it.

BARTLET
We need your take on the situation, John.

MARBURY
What is your “take” on the situation?

BARTLET
The world is coming apart at the seams.

MARBURY
Well, then... [hands his coat to Leo, imperiously] ...thank God you sent for me!

LEO
Yes.

FADE IN: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is talking on the phone.

C.J.
[into the phone] -- the Earl of Sherbourne, he is the great great grandson of a former 
Viceroy and for thirteen years served as the Queen’s minister to either India or 
Pakistan. Lord Marbury is here to council the President, and if you think this is 
all starting to sound like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I don’t blame you a bit. 

Carol and Toby appear in the doorway.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
[into the phone] Thank you. [to Carol] Yes.

CAROL
Toby’s here.

C.J.
Okay. [To Toby] Hello.

TOBY
I feel that I didn’t have the opportunity to properly articulate my argument.

C.J.
Either I’m a trusted member of the communications staff or I’m not, Toby, what was your 
argument?

TOBY
That was my argument.

C.J.
That wasn’t your argument.

TOBY
[sitting on the couch] It was my argument a little while ago, when I was arguing in my head.

C.J.
Are you apologizing?

TOBY
Yes. [long pause]

C.J.
Well?

TOBY
What?

C.J.
Apologize!

TOBY
[peevishly] I’m sorry!

C.J.
God!

TOBY
I was trying to do it nicer than that.

C.J.
[sitting next to him on the couch] Whose idea was it?

TOBY
Mine.

C.J.
You were the one who said “India’s invaded Pakistan, let’s not tell C.J.?”

TOBY
I didn’t say it like that.

C.J.
Well, how’d you say it?

TOBY
I said it nicer.

Toby looks at C.J. and gives her a very small smile.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Josh is arriving back in the office. Donna greets him.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Hi, Donna.

DONNA
I didn’t expect you back so soon.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Did everything go okay?

JOSH
[as she takes his coat] No, actually, it didn’t. Thanks.

Toby and C.J. are coming out of her office and meet Josh in the hallway heading for 
his office.

TOBY
You’re back.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Toby apologized to me.

JOSH
Listen...

C.J.
In his way.

TOBY
C.J....

JOSH
Listen, I need to tell you guys something.

They all go into Josh’s office.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam is coming back to his office. He walks past a television monitor showing soldiers 
fighting in Kashmir, sits at his desk, and stares into space. Mandy comes to his door.

MANDY
Sam? [No response.] Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

MANDY
Did you talk to him?

SAM
What?

MANDY
Did you talk to him?

SAM
It’s a bad idea, Mandy.

MANDY
Did you tell him about...?

SAM
No.

MANDY
I thought that you were the champion of bipartisan cooperation, and the spirit of...

SAM
Leo’s in trouble. You’re a political consultant. Your job isn’t to end the fight, it’s 
to win it! Now you can work for us or you can work for them, but you can’t do both.

Josh, Toby, and C.J. appear in the doorway.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Let’s go.

Josh, Sam, Toby, and C.J. leave.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Leo and Marbury are in the midst of a conversation.

LEO
Oh, I think that’s nonsense.

MARBURY
Oh, do you?

LEO
Yes. I think you’re dramatically over-estimating the possibility of escalation beyond 
the point we’re at now.

MARBURY
Interesting.

LEO
Thank you.

MARBURY
What is your name again?

LEO
All right.

MARBURY
Happily ensconced in the cocoon of your Cold War victory, you are woefully ignorant 
of the powerful historical agents in Asia. The global triumph of the economic free 
market has created an illusory assumption that the world is drawing itself closer 
together. Your Congress has been pathetically inept at halting the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in this region, and your intelligence gathering is weak. India and 
Pakistan have fought three wars in the half-century since they have gained their 
independence, with God knows how many skirmishes in between. It is about religion, 
and I can assure you, they do not share our fear of the bomb.

Charlie enters with a message and hands it to Lord Marbury.

MARBURY 
Oh, I have a telephone call. Mr. President, may I take it please in your foyer?

BARTLET
Yeah, go ahead.

MARBURY
Thank you. [leaves with Charlie]

LEO
[to Bartlet] I don’t even think the accent’s real.

BARTLET
I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.

LEO
For how long?

BARTLET
You two are going to become good friends.

LEO
He thinks I’m the butler.

BARTLET
For the first couple of weeks, so did I.

There is a knock at the door and Margaret enters.

MARGARET
Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hello, Margaret.

LEO
What do you need?

Margaret whispers in Leo’s ear.

LEO
Yeah. [to Bartlet] Would you excuse me for a moment?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh, Toby, C.J., and Sam are gathered. Leo enters, followed by Margaret.

LEO
What’s going on?

JOSH
It didn’t go well. Claypool’s got a copy of your records from rehab. Either he got 
‘em from Lillienfield or the other way around. I was in a position where I was gonna 
perjure myself, so SAM ended the deposition. Claypool’s next step is to call a reporter, 
so I’m pretty sure you’re going to be read about this soon, so I wanted to ask you, 
does your family know?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
‘Cause if they don’t, Leo...

LEO
They know.

JOSH
And the President?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
You ready for this?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
Then we’re here for whatever you need. We just wanted to come in and tell you that.

Leo looks from one to the other of them.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is seated as Charlie enters.

BARTLET
Is he still on the phone?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Do you need anything?

BARTLET
[going to his desk] There’s a quote from Revelations I’m trying to remember.

CHARLIE
[following him] I can’t help you out there, sir.

BARTLET
It’s about a horse.

CHARLIE
I’ve never read Revelations.

BARTLET
Why not?

CHARLIE
Never got around to it.

BARTLET
Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it’s not 
‘cause you’re black.

CHARLIE
[sits] I didn’t think it was.

BARTLET
It’s not.

CHARLIE
I thought it was ‘cause I’m a guy.

BARTLET
It is.

CHARLIE
I understand.

BARTLET
Still, I want you to go out with her if that’s what you both want to do.

CHARLIE
I’d like to.

BARTLET
That’s fine.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Just remember these two things: She’s nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you’re gonna get your picture taken. 
There’s gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President’s 
daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[standing] All right. You keep your head up.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Should have built a dungeon.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[now searching for something in his desk drawer] Revelations. It’s about a horse, 
and Death was riding on it maybe.

CHARLIE
Really, I haven’t read it, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Should I go check it out?

BARTLET
Yes, please.

CHARLIE
Okay.

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie.

Bartlet finds what he’s been looking for in his desk drawer - a cigarette lighter. 
Leo, Josh, C.J., Sam, and Toby enter.

BARTLET
Ah, good, I want you all to meet John.

LEO
Mr. President, before Lord Fauntleroy...

BARTLET
Lord Marbury.

LEO
Whatever. Before he comes back in the room, I wanted to tell you that Josh’s deposition 
did not go well, and that the story will probably break soon.

BARTLET
How you doing?

LEO
I’m fine.

BARTLET
Don’t you ever forget the battles you’ve fought and won.

LEO
Yes sir.

MARBURY
[enters] I’m back... and I believe there are many more people in the room.

LEO
Excellent deducing, your Lordship.

MARBURY
Mr. President, the telephone call was from the British ambassador to the United Nations. 
He believes there’ll be a cease-fire resolution within a few hours.

BARTLET
That’s what I’d heard. But all they got was two weeks.

MARBURY 
It’s two weeks better than nothing.

BARTLET
John, I was hoping you’d stick around for a couple of days and help us out.

MARBURY
A few days, a few months, however long it takes is as long as I shall serve.

LEO
Well, let’s play it by ear.

MARBURY
You’re all frightened. As well you should be. Not since the Protestant-Catholic wars 
in the 16th century has Western society known anything remotely comparable to the 
subcontinent’s religious malevolence. To a lesser observer, the intensity of the 
emotional frenzy is so illogical as to border on mass psychosis. But, as has been 
said by kings and queens, I am not a lesser observer.

BARTLET
John, there’s a quote from Revelations...

MARBURY
“And I looked, and I beheld a pale horse, and the name that sat on him was Death, and 
Hell followed with him.”

BARTLET
Are you frightened, John?

MARBURY
Do you mean do I think we can stop a war in the next two weeks?

BARTLET
Yes.

MARBURY
Yes.

BARTLET
Good.

MARBURY
But -- 

Bartlet turns to him expectantly. Marbury takes a cigarette from his pocket.

MARBURY [cont.]
-- I shall require a light.

Marbury catches the lighter Bartlet has tossed him, smiles, and lights his cigarette.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.

Transcript By: Jenn Dungan


West Wing S01E12
The White House staff is in full crisis mode when President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) is found unconscious as he prepares for the State of the Union speech while the India-Pakistan border skirmish flares again when a fearful Pakistan gives its field commanders control of its nuclear arsenal. While the President's condition is officially blamed on the flu, the First Lady (Stockard Channing) knows better, and Toby (Richard Schiff) is too busy to notice as he polishes his boss' upcoming address. Equally distracting is the inevitable disclosure of Leo's (John Spencer) former substance-abuse problem by political rivals, as well as the reappearance of the amusing Lord Marbury (Roger Rees) -- a besotted ladies' man who doubles as a key adviser on the India-Pakistan conflict. Despite the crises, C.J. (Allison Janney) and Mallory (Allison Smith) express their romantic feelings about two very different men.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet and his staff are preparing for the State of the Union address. The President, 
from behind the podium, reads the speech from the TelePrompTer.

BARTLET
With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, 
the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and the 
lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. [beat] I stand before you to report that 
America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. For the 
first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290 million 
dollars just ten years ago...

TOBY
Billion dollars.

Toby interrupts the President. Leo is seated beside him.

BARTLET
What?

TOBY
290 billion.

BARTLET
What’d I say?

TOBY
You said million, but let’s move on.

BARTLET
I said million?

TOBY
Yep.

BARTLET
[clears throat] From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten... it says “million” 
on the TelePrompTer, by the way.

TOBY
Sam?

Sam is behind them controlling the TelePrompTer with several White House staffers.

SAM
Our fault.

BARTLET
L-Let’s take it back.

The President coughs hard. He is sweating, and he looks tired.

BARTLET [cont.]
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President...

Behind all of them, Josh and C.J. are watching the President from a television. 

BARTLET [OS]
Members of the 106th Congress, distinguished guests...

JOSH
He doesn’t look so good.

C.J.
Yeah.

JOSH
He’s pale and he’s sweating.

C.J.
I know.

JOSH
You think he’s getting sick?

C.J.
I don’t know.

JOSH
Are his glands swollen?

C.J.
Damn.

JOSH
What?

C.J
You know what I forgot to do today?

JOSH
What?

C.J.
I forgot to feel the President’s glands.

JOSH
Do you think the joke reflex you use as a defense mechanism is why you have so much 
trouble keeping a man?

C.J.
You know...?

JOSH
I’m saying, we’re 44 hours away from the State of the Union, and he doesn’t look so good.

Bartlet continues to read from the TelePrompTer.

BARTLET
...And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I came to 
this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we’re spelling “hallowed” with a pound 
sign in the middle of it.

SAM
We’ll fix that.

BARTLET
The pound sign’s silent?

LEO
Move on, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the American 
dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us 
in the 321st century... Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn’t it?

SAM
[heads to the podium] Leo...

LEO
Let’s take a break.

BARTLET
We meant “stronger” here, right?

SAM
What’s it say?

BARTLET
I’m proud to report our country’s stranger than it was a year ago?

SAM
That’s a typo.

BARTLET
Could go either way.

TOBY
Sam?

SAM
Taking care of it. [leaves]

Josh and C.J. approach the President. Bartlet and his staff start to walk away.

JOSH
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yes, sir.

JOSH
How do you feel?

BARTLET
Why is everyone asking me that today?

JOSH
But you don’t look so good.

BARTLET
I’m fine.

JOSH
You’re pale and you’re perspiring.

BARTLET
I’m fine.

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

C.J.
You should be taking something, sir.

BARTLET
I’m taking many things, C.J.

C.J.
What are you taking?

BARTLET
I don’t know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.

SAM
Sir?

BARTLET
Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I’m taking something called 'euthanasia'?

SAM
Echinacea?

BARTLET
Ah, that sounds more like it... Toby?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

C.J.
Mr. President.

BARTLET
I’m taking pills, C.J.

C.J.
Are you actually taking them, or are you just carrying them around in your pocket?

BARTLET
[beat] You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step for me.

C.J.
You got to take the pills.

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

BARTLET
“How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.” 

TOBY
Oh, come on.

BARTLET
You got to add, “who work for it.”

TOBY
Sir?

JOSH
That was me.

TOBY
We’ve decided this two weeks ago.

JOSH
We’ve seen some pretty compelling polling samples. We need “people who work for it” 
and I’ll tell you what else.

TOBY
What?

JOSH
“The era of big government is over.”

TOBY
[stops] Oh, when did this happen?

JOSH
This morning, we had a meeting.

TOBY
We decided to offend poor people?

JOSH
The people we’re offending won’t be watching the State of the Union.

TOBY
Yeah, I can’t imagine why not.

The group continues to walk. They stop around the corner of THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
It’s what they’re listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it.

TOBY
Alright, but when you get visited in the middle of the night by the ghost of Christmas 
future, don’t come running to me.

BARTLET
Damn, Toby, ‘cause you’re exactly who I was gonna come running to.

TOBY
You don’t look so good.

BARTLET
Well, I’m gazing in the 321st century, man. There’s a lot on my mind.

LEO
Let’s finish up in here. [indicates the Roosevelt Room]

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J.

C.J.
Will you take them now?

BARTLET
Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben glass 
pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy.

TOBY
Mr. President?

BARTLET
I’m just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember, I got a 
really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy.

TOBY
Well, you turned me right around on that one, Mr. President.

C.J.
Sir?

BARTLET
[waves the bag of pills in the air] I will take the pills.

Bartlet goes inside THE OVAL OFFICE and closes the door. Sam, Leo, Toby, Josh, and C.J. 
are left standing outside.

SAM
You know, here’s the thing.

LEO
Hmm?

SAM
We haven’t been invited yet.

TOBY
What do you mean?

SAM
Technically, the Speaker of the House invites the President to deliver the State of 
the Union.

TOBY
And we haven’t been invited yet?

SAM
Not yet.

LEO
Is somebody seeing to this?

SAM
I’ll take care of it.

TOBY
Good, cause you know, we want to be able to report that the country’s a lot stranger 
than it was a year ago.

SAM
I’ll never be able to live it down.

LEO
No.

Leo and C.J. laugh. CRASH! The staffers heard the sound of broken glass from inside 
THE OVAL OFFICE. They quickly go inside. We see the President lying face down 
unconscious in his carpet. Beside him is the broken Steuben glass pitcher and the 
spilled water. We hear a Secret Service Agent.

AGENT [OS]
Liberty’s down. We’re in the Oval.

C.J.
Get a doctor.

Some of the group try to feel the President’s pulse from his neck.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet has regained consciousness. He is seated in a chair. The physician on duty, 
ADMIRAL HACKETT,  has just taken his temperature. The staff is around them.

HACKETT
Well, his temperature’s 101.9. I’m fairly sure he’s got the flu, but I want to take 
him to Bethesda for a cardiogram.

BARTLET
I don’t need a cardiogram.

LEO
Let’s go.

BARTLET
I got dizzy.

LEO
We’re going to the hospital.

BARTLET
I didn’t have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don’t need a cardiogram.

HACKETT
I also want blood work and a chest x-ray.

LEO
[to Hackett] You think it’s pneumonia?

HACKETT
No, I think it’s the flu, but I don’t want to fool around.

BARTLET
Leo, I’m fine.

Mrs. Landingham approaches. She gives him a piece of paper with a note on it.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham... Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You’re a very handsome man, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[to Leo] See?

LEO
[to Hackett] What do you think?

HACKETT
Uh, it can wait till morning, but I want to stay with him for an hour or two.

LEO
Do the blood work, send it to the lab, get the cardiogram and chest x-ray tomorrow.

HACKETT
Sure.

LEO
[to Bartlet] You’re going to bed.

BARTLET
Can’t yet.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Situation Room. [gives Leo the note, which he reads]

LEO
Alright, let’s do this, and then you’re going to bed. 
[to Hackett] We’ll meet you in the residence in a few minutes.

The President stands up. He gets dizzy again and almost falls down. Everyone tries 
to grab him.

JOSH
Whoa!

BARTLET
Just a little joke.

TOBY
You’re a real cut-up there, Mr. President.

BARTLET
101.9 and I still got it.

SAM
Yes, indeed, sir.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
The Joint Chiefs of Staff are inside, including the chairman, Admiral Fitzwallace. 
They are waiting for the President.

FITZWALLACE
I’m gonna tell him “steady and not egregious, sir.” We’re all okay with that?

MITCH
Yes, sir.

TOM
Yeah.

OFFICER 1
Admiral?

FITZWALLACE
What do you got?

OFFICER 1
We got the 2nd, 3rd, the 103rd, the 106th, and the 107th.

FITZWALLACE
Thank you.

The double doors open. In comes Bartlet, followed by Leo. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
all stand up.

BARTLET
Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?

MITCH
We can get that information, sir. [signals an officer to go to the phone while all sit]

LEO
What’s going on?

FITZWALLACE
Sir, there’s been steady but no egregious clashing along the cease-fire line. If you 
look at the photo-recon analysis, you’ll see India has moved new units into their four 
structures at the border.

BARTLET
It was a two-week cease-fire. There’s four days left.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, they’re getting ready.

BARTLET
What’s Intel saying about the Pakistanis?

TOM
They’re desperately concerned that if the Indians continue their offensive, they won’t 
be able to defend the capital with conventional forces.

LEO
Is this just whining or it’s for real?

FITZWALLACE
Bazin’s given command control of some of their nuclear weapons to field commanders in 
theater, but I think they’re just trying to get our attention.

BARTLET
They’ve got mine.

LEO
And they’ve got China’s.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, I’m gonna scramble the B-1’s out of Manila, and put the 49th tactical on recon on 
ready alert.

BARTLET
I’m going to bed. But somebody call me if there’s movement.

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet and Leo head for the door. The officer just got off the phone.

OFFICER 2
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

OFFICER 2
Celtics lost in overtime.

BARTLET
Ugh. Good night.

JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet and Leo leave. 

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Mandy and Danny are inside.

MANDY
That was very cute.

DANNY
So, I grow the rest of the beard back?

MANDY
Yeah.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
[comes in] Hello.

MANDY
C.J., don’t you think Danny looked very cute with the full beard?

C.J.
I actually never thought about it.

DANNY
Well, take your time.

C.J.
What do you need?

DANNY
Actually, I came by to see my fish.

C.J.
The fish is fine, and I need my office.

DANNY
I’m leaving?

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
Okay.

MANDY
Good night.

DANNY
Good night.

C.J.
[dryly] He gave me a fish a few weeks ago... that one there. [looks at Gail]

MANDY
C.J., it wouldn’t kill you to be a little friendlier to him.

C.J.
Doesn’t seem to kill you.

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J.
What do you need?

MANDY
Are you kidding me?

C.J.
Yes.

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J.
I was kidding.

MANDY
You sounded serious.

C.J.
I’m very dry.

MANDY
The story’s gonna break tomorrow.

C.J.
Leo?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
How do you know?

MANDY
It’s on the Internet.

C.J.
The whole thing?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
I’ll go talk to him. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo comes in. Margaret follows him.

MARGARET
We weren’t invited?

LEO
That’s right.

MARGARET
I thought it was a Constitutional requirement.

LEO
It is.

MARGARET
Then why do we have to be invited?

LEO
It’s a technicality.

MARGARET
I don’t...

LEO
It dates back to Parliament! What do you want from me?

MARGARET
Okay. [starts to leave]

LEO
Also, remind Josh to pick a guy.

MARGARET
Pick a guy? [writes it down]

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
He’ll know what that means?

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
Cause I don’t know.

LEO
Margaret!

MARGARET
Okay. [heads out] 

C.J.
[comes in] Excuse me.

LEO
Oh, hey, C.J.

C.J.
Hey.

LEO
What’s going on?

C.J.
How’s the President?

LEO
He’s in bed. Hackett’s up there with him.

C.J.
Does the first lady know?

LEO
She cancelled her trip. She’s on her way from Andrews.

C.J.
Leo.

LEO
It’s gonna break... tomorrow?

C.J.
Yeah, it’s on the Internet right now.

LEO
Okay.

C.J.
Why don’t we do a preemptive...

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
You’ll talk to the press in the morning?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
I’m gonna work with you first, okay?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay... [looks for a second] Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: 

INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bartlet is sitting up in his bed talking on the phone. Admiral Hackett prepares for a 
blood test as Charlie stands watch.

BARTLET
[into phone] It tested very well. I’m not saying we’re doing it, Toby. I just want to 
try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over... All right. Thanks.

Bartlet hangs up the phone. He folds his arm when Hackett finished the blood test.

CHARLIE
How you feeling, sir?

BARTLET
I’m feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes ago.

CHARLIE
I’m sorry.

BARTLET
It’s okay. This isn’t the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it’s coming up the stairs 
right now.

On cue, the bedroom door opens. Abbey comes in.

ABBEY
Hello.

BARTLET
Hello.

CHARLIE
Good evening, ma’am.

ABBEY
[puts her jacket and bag on a chair] Hey, Charlie. How you doing?

HACKETT 
Ma’am, I’m Admiral Hackett. I was on duty when it happened. [offers hand]

ABBEY
[shakes hands] Good to meet you, Admiral. Charlie, would you mind getting my bag please?

Charlie does. Abbey takes a clipboard from Hackett. The President tries to get her attention.

BARTLET
Abbey?

ABBEY
[looking at clipboard] Oh, well. 101.9.

HACKETT
Yes, ma’am.

ABBEY
When’s the last time you checked?

HACKETT
About an hour ago.

ABBEY
Pulse and pressure?

HACKETT
The pressure dropped before he fainted, but it’s coming back.

ABBEY
105 over 70.

HACKETT
Yes.

ABBEY
I want to put him on an IV/saline and vitamin solution. [to Jed] Honey, you still dizzy?

BARTLET
I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.

ABBEY
Are you still dizzy?

BARTLET
No.

ABBEY
He’s lying. Give him Flumadine, 100 milligrams, twice a day.

HACKETT
Yes, ma’am.

ABBEY
Thank you, admiral. Would you mind waiting outside for a minute?

HACKETT
No, ma’am. [leaves]

ABBEY
Thanks, Charlie. [pause] Charlie, would you mind waiting outside for a minute?

CHARLIE
No, ma’am. Do you need anything?

ABBEY
No, thanks very much.

Charlie leaves and closes the door.

BARTLET
You’re very sexy when you’re in doctor mode you know that? Give me an IV/saline 
solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat. [beat] I could jump you right now.

ABBEY
I could kill you right now.

BARTLET
My thing’s more fun.

ABBEY
[checks his eyes] It took you 25 minutes to call me.

BARTLET
Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in Kashmir.

ABBEY
I don’t care if Canada invaded Michigan, Jed. You call me.

BARTLET
Abbey?

ABBEY
Stop talking.

BARTLET
I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.

ABBEY
It’s okay.

BARTLET
Seriously, Abbey, I’m fine.

ABBEY
You could’ve hit your head on something. [gives her husband an injection]

BARTLET
[groans] But I didn’t.

ABBEY
[quietly] Was it like the time in Nantucket?

BARTLET
Yeah.

ABBEY
Or was it like the time at my parents?

BARTLET
I really don’t remember.

ABBEY
It’s all right. Close your eyes. You’re gonna be asleep in a minute.

Abbey takes the pillow from behind Bartlet, who lies down.

BARTLET
Fitzwallace says the Pakistanis are giving command control to some nuclear weapons 
to the field.

ABBEY
It’s okay. Leo’s in the West Wing.

BARTLET
I’m really sorry about the pitcher.

ABBEY
Just go to sleep, baby.

BARTLET
I could jump you right now.

ABBEY
Yeah, sure you could.

Bartlet falls to sleep. Abbey, fighting back tears, sits on a chair and looks around 
the room.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is talking on the phone.

JOSH
[into phone] I don’t think it’s being sorted in the mailroom. It’s an invitation to 
the President to address Congress. I’m assuming it was hand-delivered. [listens]
Thank you.

Donna knocks at the door. 

JOSH
Yes?

DONNA
Margaret came by.

JOSH
Yes.

Josh goes out the door into his BULLPEN AREA. Donna follows.

DONNA
She said Leo said to remind you you need to pick a guy.

JOSH
Right.

DONNA
She said you’d know what that means.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Do you know what that means?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA 
I don’t know what that means.

JOSH
Someone from the line of succession is required to be absent from the State of the Union.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
Donna?

DONNA
Wait, I know why. 

They walk to the NORTHWEST LOBBY.

DONNA
So if somebody blows up the building, nobody’s...

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Who are you gonna pick?

JOSH
Who do you think I should pick?

DONNA
I think you should pick me.

JOSH
You think so?

DONNA
Yeah, I’ll be good.

JOSH
And where exactly do you fall in the line of succession?

DONNA
If somebody blows up the Capitol Building, I’d imagine I’d move up a few slots.

JOSH
Fair point.

They open the door to a HALLWAY.

DONNA
So who’s it gonna be?

JOSH
Roger Tribby.

DONNA
The secretary of agriculture?

JOSH
Yes. [stops] Listen. Be sweet to Margaret and Leo today. This might not be the worst 
day of their lives, but it’s got to be in the top five.

DONNA
Okay.

JOSH
See ya later.

Donna goes the other way. Josh continues walking.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh comes in and closes the door. Leo is reading a speech that was prepared. 
They’re rehearsing for his press conference. Sam and C.J. are seated on the couch.

LEO
I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people in my life...

JOSH
When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings? 

LEO
A.A. meetings?

C.J.
Don’t say A.A. if they don’t say A.A.

JOSH
[sits] When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
Do you still attend them?

LEO
Yes.

C.J., Sam, Josh are surprised. 

C.J.
Where?

LEO
I won’t answer that.

C.J.
How often?

LEO
I won’t answer that, either.

JOSH
How about as often as I need to?

SAM
Need?

JOSH
He’s right.

C.J.
Don’t answer it.

LEO
What else?

SAM
Has the President known?

LEO
The President and I have a long history and a close personal friendship...

SAM
You didn’t answer the question.

LEO
The President has known, as well as the FBI and the Secret Service.

C.J.
Did they raise any objection to a man with your problem in such a sensitive position?

LEO
Yeah, they were concerned I’d sell state secrets to Bolivia for a quick...

JOSH
It’s not a totally unreasonable question.

LEO
Yeah, I’m all set.

C.J.
Okay.

Leo goes to his desk. Sam, Josh and C.J. stand and get ready to leave.

SAM
Uh, Leo, I wrote a draft to the President’s statement of support. I thought you might 
want to...

LEO
[surprised] What did you do?

SAM
I wrote a draft to the President’s statement of support.

LEO
Who told you to do that?

SAM
The President’s in no condition...

LEO
[yells] I know what conditions he’s in. I’m asking who told you to write a statement 
of support?

JOSH
Toby told him last night to...

SAM
Nobody had to tell me. You’re about to get attacked. It’s what I do.

LEO
No, your job isn’t to protect me, Sam. It’s to protect the President.

SAM
Leo...

LEO
Do me a favor, Sam. Don’t show initiative. Don’t rush to my defense. I don’t want to 
see you on Crossfire. I don’t want to see you on Larry King. I don’t want to read your 
name in Newsweek unless it’s an advocacy of the President’s agenda.
[calms down] I go down, I go down. I’m not taking anyone with me... Is that clear?

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
I’m all set. Go back to work.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - DAY

Bartlet, now awake, sits up on his side of the bed still in his pajamas. Abbey, all 
dressed up, is seated beside him and has just finished taking her husband’s temperature.

ABBEY
Well, the good news is, your temperature’s gone down.

BARTLET
Can I go to the office?

ABBEY
No.

BARTLET
Why not?

ABBEY
It hasn’t gone down enough, and it’s gonna go back up again.

BARTLET
Why?

ABBEY
‘Cause you have the flu.

Abbey takes her stethoscope and puts the end on the President’s back. She listens.

BARTLET
Here’s the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med school.

ABBEY
Deep breath.

BARTLET
Do you even know what you’re listening for right now? [inhales]

ABBEY
Do you know how many other people I could have married?

BARTLET
[exhales] How many?

ABBEY
Shhh.

BARTLET
I’m going to the office.

ABBEY
Okay.

BARTLET
Really?

ABBEY
Feel free.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet takes off his blanket and tries to stand up. Before he could, he realizes he’s 
still dizzy and sits back down.

BARTLET
Uh-oh.

ABBEY
Anything else?

BARTLET
Alright. I think I’ll stay here for a little bit.

ABBEY
Okay.

The President puts back his blanket.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Leo is waiting just outside the briefing room. Carol opens the door.

CAROL
Leo?

LEO
Mm-hmm?

CAROL
They’re ready for you.

LEO
Thank you.

CAROL
You need anything?

LEO
No.

Leo goes into the PRESS BRIEFING ROOM. The reporters are on their seats. Cameras 
flash. Leo steps behind the podium.

LEO
Good morning.

REPORTERS
Good morning.

LEO
A story, in which many, if not most of you, are aware of already, will break in wide 
circulation by the end of the day. I’d like to take this opportunity to read a brief 
statement before I answer your questions. 
[starts reading] In June of 1993, I voluntarily admitted myself to the Sierra-Tucson 
Rehabilitation Facility to treat an addiction to alcohol and Valium.
[looks up, cameras flash from everywhere]
I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.
[looks up again] I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people 
in my life. I’d like to, at this point, clarify a few things...

DISSOLVE TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Donna and Josh are walking.

DONNA
Roger Tribby.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
I don’t know why you’re picking the secretary of agriculture.

JOSH
Because the secretaries of defense, state and treasury are famous faces, and we want 
the camera to find them.

DONNA
So, if the Capitol Building blows up...

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
The man my country will be looking to is the secretary of agriculture.

JOSH
It’s my country too.

DONNA
Yeah, but you’ll be dead.

JOSH
Which is why I really don’t care that much.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Donna, I really don’t anticipate the Capitol Building exploding.

DONNA
What percentage of things exploding have been anticipated?

JOSH
Now you’re bringing me down.

DONNA
I would think so. [walks away]

JOSH
[sees Sam] Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

JOSH
I thought he did well.

SAM
Yeah, he did.

JOSH
I read the statement you wrote for the President--sensational, Sam. I’m sorry no one’s 
gonna read it.

SAM
The President’s gonna read it. He’s reading it right now.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
I don’t care.

JOSH
Leo’s gonna kill us!

SAM
I don’t care. Do you?

JOSH
Nah.

We pan to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Toby is having a meeting with RAYMOND BURNS and two 
other Congressmen about the State of the Union address.

BURNS
Toby, I’m concerned that the speech contains a number of positions that democrats and 
Congress aren’t quite on board with yet.

TOBY
They’re free to write they’re own speech.

BURNS
I understand, but they are the ones who are gonna have to run against us a year from now.

TOBY
What are your concerns?

CONGRESSMAN
We feel, even in this draft--

BURNS
And, you’ve made some progress.

CONGRESSMAN
Yes, but even in this draft, there’s too much emphasis placed on the role of federal 
government.

TOBY
I’ve pared down...

BURNS
We know.

TOBY
This is an opportunity for a pep rally. This is an opportunity to trumpet government. 
Why do we want to pretend to be sorry for intruding?

CONGRESSMAN
Because that’s what people want to hear.

TOBY
So I’ve been told.

BURNS
Toby?

TOBY
Why don’t’ you pick your section of the speech. Fight with me about it, and I’ll lose, 
and then I can call in the next group.

BURNS
You understand--

TOBY
Pick a section. There’s a line waiting outside. I’ve got 31 hours to-to write this...

BURNS
We don’t--

CONGRESSMAN
Federal funding for the arts.

TOBY
The N.E.A.? [sighs] Let us open our hymnals to page 22.

The Congressman smiles.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is reading a piece of paper. The television on his right broadcasts his press 
conference. He looks at himself for a brief moment. He turns the TV off with a remote 
control before Margaret walks in.

MARGARET
Leo? Mallory’s here.

LEO
Okay.

MALLORY [OS]
[to Margaret] Thanks. [walks in] Dad?

LEO
Hey, Mal. [hugs her daughter]

MALLORY
Are you okay?

LEO
I’m fine.

MALLORY
You told me your press conference was gonna be this afternoon.

LEO
I told you that I didn’t know...

MALLORY
I wanted to be there.

LEO
It’s okay.

MALLORY
No, it’s not. Mom and I should have been there.

LEO
Oh, yes, definitely a picture of me standing next to my estranged wife--

MALLORY
Dad?

LEO
Mallory?

MALLORY
I don’t want to fight with you.

LEO
Okay... Anyway...

MALLORY
I saw a copy of the President’s statement.

LEO
[surprised] What statement?

MALLORY
For the press, supporting you. It’s-it’s floating around.

LEO
It’s floating around?

MALLORY
It’s very moving, dad. He loves you so much.

LEO
Excuse me. [heads out]

Sam talks to a staffer. Josh comes up from behind.

SAM
Pages one and two.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

JOSH
Where are we at?

SAM
We’re getting slapped around on the N.E.A.

JOSH
Oh, man! Why is he...?

They go into SAM’S OFFICE.

SAM
Josh.

JOSH
I mean N.E.A. is putting up a fight...

Leo walks in. He’s angry.

LEO
You did it again.

JOSH
Leo...

LEO
[yells] You did it again!

JOSH
I understand you’re being pissed off--

LEO
Has the President seen it?

JOSH
Yes, and he--

LEO
Who gave it to him?

JOSH
Leo?

LEO
Who gave it to him?

JOSH
I did.

SAM
I did.

LEO
What, you’re giving me Abbott and Costello?

SAM
I did.

LEO
I told you...

SAM
They want to tear you down, plain and simple. They don’t like you and this is what 
they do, and for us not to defend you? I disobeyed you. I apologize, but that’s the 
way it is.

Behind Leo, Bonnie just got off the phone.

BONNIE
Leo?

LEO
Yeah?

BONNIE
The First Lady’s in your office.

LEO
Thank you. [to Sam] This is not what I wanted. [walks away]

Abbey is joking with Mallory.

ABBEY
Ah-ah-ah-ah! 

MALLORY
Abbey?

ABBEY
You’ve got an itch for Sam Seaborn.

MALLORY
I do not have an itch.

ABBEY
A little itch.

MALLORY
Abbey? You...

ABBEY
Want a nickel worth of free advice?

MALLORY
Sure.

ABBEY
Don’t go for the geniuses. They never want to sleep.

LEO
[walks in] Hey.

ABBEY
Oh, Leo, hi. I’m sorry. I hope I didn’t take you away from something.

LEO
Oh, no, no, no. Mallory, would you mind...?

MALLORY
I do not have an itch!

LEO
[surprised] Mallory?!

MALLORY
I’m going.

ABBEY
[kisses Mallory] Bye sweetie.

MALLORY
[kisses Leo] Bye daddy.

Mallory leaves and closes the door. Abbey shifts to the couch. 

ABBEY
You did good today.

LEO
Thank you.

ABBEY
Mallory was very proud of you.

LEO
Well...

ABBEY
Leo, I came by because I wanted to ask do you think there’s a huge downside to 
postponing for a few days?

LEO
Did the fever go back up?

ABBEY
No, it’s going down.

LEO
Abbey? What’s going on?

ABBEY
Nothing. Uh, like I say--

LEO
What should I know that I don’t know?

ABBEY
I just thought we should be on the safe side.

LEO
Why’d you cancel your trip?

ABBEY
Because he has the--

LEO
Because that President has a temperature. The President’s not in nursery school.

ABBEY
Look, if it’s a problem to postpone--

LEO
It’s not a problem to postpone. Of course, I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize the 
President’s health. What I’m saying...

ABBEY
Leo, please.

LEO
[sits] Hey, hey, hey. This is me. This has happened before. I see you trying to 
cover the panic. I see you prescribing medication. I think you’re giving him shots. 
What does he have he can’t tell people?

ABBEY
He has the flu.

LEO
Ugh! You would not have come back for the flu, Abbey.

ABBEY
He fainted. He was running a fever.

LEO
Abbey?

A pause. Almost in tears, Abbey decides to tell him the truth.

ABBEY
He has multiple sclerosis, Leo.

LEO
[shocked] Oh, Abbey.

ABBEY
A fever could be life threatening.

Abbey tries hard to fight back tears, but couldn't. A tear falls from her eye.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - DAY

The television is on. A soap opera playing.

WOMAN IN T.V.
Mrs. Crane, there are some things you mustn’t say to Chief Bennett. He’s married to 
someone else and so are you.

Bartlet is in bed eating breakfast. Charlie is seated on a chair.

BARTLET
I don’t understand. Don’t any of these characters have jobs?

CHARLIE
I don’t know, Mr. President. I think one of them is a surgeon.

BARTLET
They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.

The phone rings. Charlie answers it.

CHARLIE
Hello?

BARTLET
And that woman’s changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.

CHARLIE
[hangs up] Mr. President, Mr. McGarry’s outside.

BARTLET
Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?

CHARLIE
No sir. [leaves]

Bartlet turns the T.V. off. Charlie closes the door when Leo walks in. Leo walks over 
to the President.

BARTLET
Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years 
ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing-remitting, 
which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections 
of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to 
be two things that induces attacks.

LEO
Well, you’re the President of the United States, you’re delivering the State of the Union 
tomorrow night, India and Pakistan are pointing nuclear weapons at each other, and you 
have a 102-degree fever. So I guess we’re out of the woods, hmm?

BARTLET
101.9.

LEO
Jed, of all the things you could’ve kept from me...

BARTLET
You haven’t called me “Jed” since I was elected.

LEO
[sits] Why didn’t you tell me?

BARTLET
‘Cause I wanted to be the President.

LEO
That wouldn’t have stopped me from getting you here. And I could’ve been a friend.

BARTLET
You’ve been a friend.

LEO
But when it was time to really...

BARTLET
I know.

LEO
When I was lying on my face in the motel parking lot, you were the one I called.

BARTLET
When you stood up there today, I was so proud. I wanted to be with you.

LEO
Nah. Nah.

BARTLET
I tried to get up, but I fell back down again.

LEO
I know the feeling.

BARTLET
[fights back tears] I’m so sorry, Leo. I really am.

CHARLIE
[opens the door] Mr. President?

LEO
Don’t worry about it.

BARTLET
Yeah, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Lord Marbury.

BARTLET
Yeah, give us a minute, would you please?

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby is still in his meeting.

BURNS
Now, the President’s proposing in his speech that the budget by the N.E.A. be increased 
by fifty percent?

TOBY
The National Endowment amounts to less than 1/100th of one percent of the total budget 
for the federal government. It costs taxpayers 39 cents a year. The arts budget for the 
U.S. is equivalent to the arts budget of Sweden.

BURNS
That is such a big deal being made out of the performance arts of the Mapplethorpe 
photographs--

TOBY
You gay bashing, Raymond?

BURNS
Well, once again, all we’d like is for you to not mention the N.E.A.

CONGRESSMAN
Personally, I don’t know what to say to people who argue that the N.E.A. is there to 
support art that nobody wants to pay for in the first place. I don’t know what to tell 
people when they say Rogers and Hart didn’t need the N.E.A. to write Oklahoma, and Arthur 
Murray didn’t need the N.E.A. to write Death of a Salesman.

TOBY
I’d start by telling them that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote Oklahoma, and Arthur Murray 
taught ballroom dance, and Arthur Miller did need the N.E.A. to write Death of a Salesman, 
but it wasn’t called the N.E.A. back then. It was called W.P.A. and it was Roosevelt’s...
[long pause] It was Roosevelt’s...

BURNS
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

BURNS
You stopped talking in the middle of a...?

TOBY
Thank you everybody. This meeting is over.

Toby leaves. The congressmen looked surprised.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are settled on the couch. Lord Marbury is across them.

MARBURY
You know, there are some marvelous flu remedies known in the certain remote parts of 
the subcontinent. Licorice root, for instance, combined with bamboo sap and a strong 
shot of whiskey. Ginger root, also, mixed with, uh, citrus peel.

BARTLET
And a strong shot of whiskey?

MARBURY
Yes, of course. In fact, you can throw out the ginger root and citrus peel, and still 
be well in your way.

BARTLET
What have you got for me, John?

MARBURY
Well, um, after speaking at length this past week with your secretaries of state and 
defense, as well as your joint chiefs and various embassy officials, I believe this.
Buy them off.

BARTLET
Buy them?

MARBURY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How?

MARBURY
Mr. President, for several centuries, my kingdom has ruled India with a stick and carrot. 
When we had a particular problem with someone, one solution we would try is to make him 
a maharaja. That’s kind of a regional king. We would pay him off with an annual tribute, 
and in return, he would be loyal to the crown.

LEO
Lord Marbury, under our Constitution, our President is not empowered to create maharajas.

MARBURY
Yes. Thank you for clearing that up, Leo. Having been educated at Cambridge and the 
Sorbonne, I am, as you know, exceedingly stupid.

BARTLET
John, please.

MARBURY
You’ve been paying the world off since the industrial age. Foreign aid, during the Cold 
War was you paying dictators to be on your side. To this very day, you pay Korea not to 
develop nuclear weapons.

BARTLET
What does India want?

MARBURY
A computer industry, and for that, they require an infrastructure, and that is what you 
can give them.

LEO
Why?

MARBURY
It’s the price you pay.

LEO
For avoiding a war halfway around the world?

MARBURY
For being rich, free and alive all at the same time, and for the criminally negligent 
behavior of your Congress in not checking the proliferation of nuclear devices.

BARTLET
Your friend, the prime minister?

MARBURY
Rikki.

BARTLET
He’s gonna go for this?

MARBURY
If it’s handled properly.

BARTLET
All right, you tell the ambassador we’ll discuss this in three months. In three months, 
John. I don’t want this to be like quid pro quo.

MARBURY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
That’s the carrot. Leo, what’s the stick?

LEO
In the next 24 hours, we want to see recon photos of Indian divisions retreating. If we 
don’t, we’re gonna seize Indian assets and so will our NATO allies, and G-7’s gonna call 
in its loans.

BARTLET
They put command-control in the field, John, and we’re gonna get physical. You make damn 
sure they know that.

MARBURY
Well, then, uh, I have my instructions. 

The three of them stand.

BARTLET
Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.

MARBURY
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [leaves]

CHARLIE
[opens the door] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yes, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Toby’s here.

BARTLET
Toby, come in please.

LEO
I’m gonna go back to the office.

BARTLET
Let’s hope.

TOBY
[enters] Leo.

LEO
Hey, Toby. [leaves]

TOBY
How you feeling, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Much better. Thank you.

TOBY
Good.

BARTLET
You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving moderator 
who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of problems with 
their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with the girlfriend’s 
mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right there on television. 
Toby, tell me, these people don’t vote, do they?

TOBY
I wouldn’t think so. No sir.

JOSH
[pokes his head in] Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What do you need, Josh?

TOBY
I asked Josh to join me here, sir.

BARTLET
[sits] What’s on your mind?

TOBY
The era of big government is over.

BARTLET
You want to cut the line?

TOBY
I want to change the sentiment. We’re running away from ourselves, and I know we can score 
points that way. I was the principle architect in that campaign strategy, right along with 
you, Josh. But we’re here now. Tomorrow night, we do an immense thing. We have to say what 
we feel. That government, no matter what its failures are in the past, and in times to come, 
for that matter, the government can be a place where people come together and where no one 
gets left behind. No one... gets left behind, an instrument of... good. 
[pause] I have no trouble understanding why the line tested well, Josh, but I don’t think 
that means we should say it. I think that means we should... change it.

BARTLET
I think so, too. [beat] What do you think, Josh?

JOSH
I’d make it a point never to disagree with Toby when he’s right, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Toby and Josh leave.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Everyone is waiting for the State of the Union address. Josh, Sam, and C.J. are having 
a conversation.

JOSH
[sing-song] You’re jealous ‘cause Danny was flirting with Mandy.

C.J.
I didn’t say that. When did I say that?

JOSH
I read between the lines.

C.J.
There are no lines.

SAM
You know, C.J., it can be pretty confusing sometimes. I mean I’m at this place with 
Mallory, where I don’t know if she likes me. I don’t know if she doesn’t like me. 
I don’t know if she’s indifferent altogether. I just wish she’d take the bull by the 
horns and get past it so we can move on.

Across the room, Mallory finds Sam.

MALLORY
Sam! Did you write this statement defending my father?

SAM
Uh, yes.

Mallory walks over to Sam and kisses him. She pulls back then kisses him again, this time 
longer than the first. Josh and C.J. just stare at them. Mallory walks away after the kiss.

SAM
Well, now I’m even more confused.

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
Though, I gotta say, I’m enjoying being a writer.

C.J. looks around the room. She sees Carol.

C.J.
Carol, is Danny Concannon in the Press Room?

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J.
Would you have him come to my office, please?

C.J. smiles as CAROL walks away.

his sleeve.

ABBEY
I want to take your temperature one last time.

BARTLET
Abbey...?

ABBEY
I want to take your temperature.

BARTLET
You’ve taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You’re not taking it again.

ABBEY
Mmm... Fine.

BARTLET
At least not with a thermometer.

ABBEY
Oh, Jed.

BARTLET
I’m saying if you want to take it recreationally...

ABBEY
Oh, there’s something wrong with you, you know that?

BARTLET
Yes, I do.

ABBEY
Why is “hallowed” spelled with a pound sign in the middle?

BARTLET
I stopped asking those questions.

Bartlet takes off his wife’s glasses and kisses her.

Can I come in?

DANNY
C.J, this is your office.

C.J. [OS]
Right. [opens the door and comes in] Hello.

DANNY
Hello.

C.J.
So... you have asked me out many times. I have said no.

DANNY
You said yes once.

C.J.
That was a business dinner.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
Nonetheless, I do seem to have a preoccupation, um, sort of girlish, I suppose, thing, 
which, um... and please don’t be in any way mislead by anything... in fact, let me put 
it this way...

DANNY
C.J., I’m gonna write about the speech tonight. My paper’s gonna want to, you know, 
see it. Is there any way we can move this along?

C.J.
I thought what I’d do is kiss you, you know, on the mouth, then I’d just get past it... 
I’d just get past it, and I’ll be able to give my work the kind of concentration it 
really deserves.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
How’s right here?

DANNY
That’s fine.

C.J.
Be careful of the fish. 

DANNY
Sure

C.J.
No, I’m saying cause if you rock against the...

Danny grabs C.J. and kisses her.

DANNY
How’s that?

C.J.
Oh, good.

DANNY
Past it?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Good.

C.J.
Okay, I got to go now. [takes Gail with her and heads out]

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
Taking that fish with you?

No.

She puts the fishbowl back on the table and heads out. She bumps into the door.

And a shot of whiskey in the old sense.

Abbey laughs. They see Bartlet and Leo walking in. They all stand by the door.

ABBEY
Hello.

BARTLET
Good evening.

MARBURY
Good evening, Mr. President.

Bartlet gives him several photographs.

MARBURY
[goes over the pictures] Uh, well now, if I’m not mistaken, these are photos of Indian 
troops retreating, and so is that, and so is... this.

BARTLET
Thank you, John.

MARBURY
Well, I’m on a plane to go see Rikki in an hour... still many things to settle.

BARTLET
Godspeed, your Lordship.

MARBURY
Thank you sir.

They shake hands.

MARBURY
Abigail! [kisses Abbey on the cheek]

LEO
Good luck, John.

MARBURY
Good luck to you too, Leo.

Leo shakes hands with Marbury.

MARBURY
I am off! [walks away]

Bartlet, Abbey, and Leo step inside THE MURAL ROOM.

BARTLET
Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion, wit, skill, 
and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my delivery 
later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler, and I say 
thee yea! Sam Seaborn!

Everyone in the room clap their hands for the President’s speechwriters. Charlie comes 
in and informs the President.

CHARLIE
Sir, the motorcade’s ready and the agriculture secretary is in the Oval Office.

Bartlet nods. Everyone is still clapping for Toby and Sam.

CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Charlie opens the door from outside. Bartlet walks in. The secretary of agriculture, 
ROGER TRIBBY, is standing in the middle of the room.

BARTLET
Roger.

TRIBBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Roger, I’m sorry you drew the short straw on this. We’ll miss you tonight. Next year, 
it’ll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my study.

TRIBBY
Thank you, sir. [beat] Um, I brought you a gift. [offers him a book]

BARTLET
Oh, thank you.

TRIBBY
I know of your love of all things ancient, and I came across this.

BARTLET
What is it?

TRIBBY
Someone took the time to translate the Constitution into Latin. I think it was a high 
school project, actually, and uh, it got published.

BARTLET
This is magnificent.

TRIBBY
I highlighted what I thought was an appropriate passage from the executive power section. 
Can you translate?

BARTLET
[reads] “He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information on the state of 
the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary 
and expedient.”

TRIBBY
Sounds right up your alley, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you, Roger.

TRIBBY
Knock ‘em dead, sir.

Bartlet heads to the door. He stops as he remembers something.

BARTLET
Oh, Roger, if anything happened, you know what to do, right?

TRIBBY
I honestly hadn’t thought about it sir.

BARTLET
First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint joint 
chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send emergency 
delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the acting A.G. 
If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells you.

LEO'S OFFICE. As Bartlet tells Tribby the procedure, we see Leo walk into his office 
to get his coat. The door to the Oval Office is open so he can hear the President 
and Tribby, but couldn’t see them.

BARTLET
You have a best friend?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Is he smarter than you?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Would you trust him with your life?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
That’s your chief of staff.

Leo, obvioiusly touched, stops for a minute and walks away.

Back in THE OVAL OFFICE, Charlie walks in. Bartlet continues to speak.

BARTLET
Oh, in the residence, in the second floor, the bathroom at the end of the hall. 
You have to jiggle the handle a little.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
I got to go. [beat] You’ll do fine. People have phenomenal capacity.

ROGER
Yes, sir.

Bartlet holds his book and puts his fist against his chest close to the heart. Tribby 
stands watch as the President and Charlie leave. After they've gone, Tribby is standing 
in front of the Presidential seal and looks around the Oval Office in awe.

West Wing S01E13
While President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and his staff debate the appropriate response to a controversial new sex education study, there are fears that the parents of a murdered gay teenager should be excused from attending the signing of a hate crimes bill because of the father's embarrassment about his son's homosexuality. Josh (Bradley Whitford) and Sam (Rob Lowe) meet with an appropriations subcommittee which is investigating Josh's lack of cooperation in the White House staff drug probe -- all of which is designed to expose Leo's (John Spencer) former substance-abuse problem. Toby (Richard Schiff) relishes his verbal duel with some congressmen who have held up the newest appointments for the Public Broadcasting Corporation. C.J. (Allison Janney) is advised to save a few embarrassing stories for release on Friday to blunt the effect on the media over the weekend, but she also finds time to continue her frisky flirtation with a White House reporter, Danny (Timothy Busfield).

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT 
C.J. is carrying out the last press briefing of the day. 

C.J.
...weather permitting we'll be in the rose garden. 

REPORTER 1 
And weather permitting means? 

C.J.
If it's not raining. 

REPORTER 1 
C.J.... 

C.J.
I know. 

REPORTER 2 
It's gonna be 22 degrees out there. 

C.J.
I know. 

REPORTER 2 
I don't know why you people... 

C.J. 
This President is from New England and I think it's time we all started getting used 
to that. At least, that's what he told me this morning. What else do we have here? 
There will be 15 pen recipients. The President will sign the bill with 15 pens, and 
I guess someone on my staff wanted you to know that. 

DANNY
C.J.? 

C.J.
Tell me you don't have a question about the pens. 

DANNY
C.J., I have a question about the pens. 

C.J.
Yes, Danny? 

DANNY
Josiah Bartlet has 13 letters in it, how's the President gonna use 15 pens? 

C.J.
Danny... 

DANNY
I just.... 

C.J.
You know you were the only one in the room doing the math on that, right? 

DANNY
I, I just... 

C.J.
Only one in the room. 

DANNY
My readers expect a little bit more. [laughter] 

C.J.
[leafing through notes] 15 pens, 13 letters, they must have stuck something in here 
about... Yes... he's gonna... interesting... he's gonna literally dot the I" and 
cross the "T"s. 

DANNY
Thank you. 

C.J.
Freakboy. 

DANNY
Thank you again. 

C.J.
Jonathon and Jennifer Lydell, the parents of Lowell Lydell, have been added to the 
guest list; also added to the guest list are senators... 

Mandy watches from the back. 

REPORTER 3 
C.J.? 

C.J.
Yeah? 

REPORTER 3 
That still on? 

C.J.
What still on? 

REPORTER 3 
The Lydells. 

C.J.
Yeah. 

REPORTER 3
There's a rumour that the Lydells aren't big supporters of the President, and they 
were, er, reluctant.. 

C.J.
I've heard that too, and I don't know where it got started; it's ridiculous. The 
President's signing hate crimes legislation, Jonathan and Jennifer Lydell's son was 
killed for being gay. They're obviously going to...

Mandy watches anxiously. 

REPORTER 3 
Just asking. 

REPORTER 4 
I heard the same thing. 

C.J.
The Lydells are coming. 

REPORTER 3 
And they'll be available to the press? 

C.J.
Yeah. Where was I? 

REPORTER 2 
Senators. 

C.J.
Breach and Larkin. Senators Breach and Larkin will be attending as well. 

Mandy watches C.J. on the T.V. 

C.J.
Listen, you've been a great audience, don't forget to tip your waitresses. That's all 
the news today, you're outta here. 

C.J. leaves the room and Mandy joins her as they walk together. 

MANDY
I kinda wish you hadn't done that. 

C.J.
Done what? 

MANDY
Guaranteed the Lydells. 

C.J.
They're not coming? 

MANDY
They are coming, I'm just not sure we're gonna want them there. 

C.J.
Mandy! 

MANDY
I flew out to St Paul; I sat in their kitchen. 

C.J.
I spoke the mother on the phone. I spoke to her twice! 

MANDY
The mother's fine. 

C.J.
What's wrong with the father? 

MANDY
He doesn't say much. 

C.J.
That's it? 

MANDY
Sometimes that's an indication... 

C.J.
He doesn't say much? 

MANDY
C.J.... 

C.J.
Their son was just murdered Mandy! Did you want him to wear a campaign button? 

MANDY
I do at the bill signing and I'm saying the reticence he exhibited in his kitchen... 

C.J.
Are you listening to yourself? 

MANDY
They're flying in in the morning. Sit and meet with them and tell me what you think. 

C.J.
You want me to audition the Lydells? 

MANDY
Yes. And I'd also like you to cut me some slack. 

C.J.
Fine. 

Mandy walks off and C.J. walks into her office, stopping to talk to Carol. 

C.J.
Carol? Dotting the "I"s and crossing the "T"s, thank you for that. 

CAROL 
We do our homework. 

C.J.
You misspelled senator. 

Josh joins C.J. in her office.

C.J.
Hello. 

JOSH
We've got a bit of a sticky wicket. 

C.J.
Please don't tell me I'm staying here and working late tonight. 

JOSH
I need you to read a report. 

C.J.
I'm a woman in her prime, Josh. I'm a prime woman. 

JOSH
There's no doubt about it, but I need you to read this anyway. 

C.J.
What is it? 

JOSH
We want Congress to sign off on funds for a hundred thousand new teachers. They say, 
fine, but you gotta stipulate that in Sex Ed classes.... 

C.J.
Abstinence only? 

JOSH
Yes. 

C.J.
I would no have trouble passing such a class. 

JOSH
We commissioned a report about a year ago on Sex Education in public schools, and, 
well, this is it. [drops the report on C.J.'s desk]

C.J.
What's it say? 

JOSH
It's not good. 

C.J.
How's it not good? 

JOSH
It says basically that teaching abstinence only doesn't work- that people are going 
to be prone to have sex whether they're cautioned against it or not. 

C.J.
Well, what are they recommending? 

JOSH
Something called "abstinence plus". 

C.J.
Abstinence plus? 

JOSH
Yes. 

C.J.
What's that mean? 

JOSH
Well, Sam's renamed it 'everything but'. 

C.J.
Everything but? 

JOSH
Yes. 

C.J.
Ah. 

JOSH
Yes. 

C.J.
They want teachers to teach... 

JOSH
Yes. 

C.J.
And so the sticky wicket joke was...? 

JOSH
A regrettable pun. Should I order you some food? 

C.J.
Y'know, I can't remember the last time I got home before midnight. 

JOSH
By the way, pages 27 to 33? A couple of things every girl should know. 

C.J.
Get me a salad. 

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
Danny walks in. C.J. is inside.

C.J.
Hey. 

DANNY
Want to have dinner? 

C.J.
With you? 

DANNY
Yes. 

C.J.
I have to read a report on Sex Education. 

DANNY
Hey... 

C.J.
I'm anticipating any joke you could possibly make right now, and I'm not finding any 
of them funny. 

DANNY
You know, eventually you're gonna have to go on a date with me; you can't just keep 
grabbing me and kissing me. 

C.J.
I didn't grab you... 

DANNY
Well, you can, like I'll mind or anything... 

C.J.
I didn't grab you. You grabbed me!

DANNY 
First time. Second, third and fourth times you grabbed me. 

C.J.
That's because... 

DANNY
All week long, just randomly grabbing me and kissing me. Like I said, I applaud the spirit, 
but I think there's, there's better things ahead. As I'm sure you're about to read. 

C.J.
What do you want? 

DANNY
I want to know about an advance man for the Vice-President who took a Navy helicopter to 
Pebble beach to shoot 18 holes. 

C.J.
Are you kidding me? 

DANNY
No. 

C.J.
How do you know about this? 

DANNY
A White House source. 

C.J.
What kind of White House source? 

DANNY
The anonymous kind. 

C.J.
I'll find out about it. 

DANNY
Do it properly would you? I got a helicopter pilot who sat around for four hours on the 
taxpayers' time while your advance man hit every sand trap in Carmel. 

C.J.
Okay. 

DANNY
See ya. 

C.J.
Wait. [grabs and kisses Danny] Okay, you can go now. 

DANNY
No problem. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Carol is holding food.

DONNA
Josh? [to Carol] Did they burn the hamburger? 

CAROL 
I told them well-done. 

DONNA
He likes it beyond well-done. He likes it burnt. 

JOSH
[comes out of his office] Yeah? 

DONNA
Food's here. 

JOSH
Did they burn the hamburger? 

DONNA
Yes. 

JOSH
Did you check? 

DONNA
I am not checking your food. 

JOSH
Let's go. 

DONNA
[picks up the box of food] No, no, I'll carry it. [walks with Josh]

JOSH
I like it where if you dropped it on the floor it would break. 

DONNA
What's 'Take Out the Trash Day'? 

JOSH
Friday. 

DONNA
I mean what is it? 

JOSH
Any stories we have to give the press that we're not wild about we give all in a lump 
on Friday. 

DONNA
Why do you do it in a lump? 

JOSH
Instead of one at a time? 

DONNA
I'd think you'd want to spread them out. 

JOSH
They've got X column inches to fill, right? They're gonna fill them no matter what. 

DONNA
Yes. 

JOSH
So if we give them one story, that story's X column inches. 

DONNA
And if we give them 5 stories... 

JOSH
They're a fifth the size. 

DONNA
Why do you do it on Friday? 

JOSH
Because no one reads the paper on Saturday. 

DONNA
You guys are real populists, aren't you? 

JOSH
The salad's for C.J.. 

They walk off in opposite directions. 

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Toby is working at his desk. Sam enters quietly. 

TOBY
Yeah? 

SAM
There is a town in Alabama that wants to abolish all laws except the Ten Commandments. 

TOBY
I saw it. 

SAM
Well, they're gonna have a problem. 

TOBY
Because the Constitution prohibits religious activity in any form connected to Government? 

SAM
Good point! Two problems. 

TOBY
Sam, I'm busy here! 

SAM
I just mean that some of those Commandments are pretty hard to enforce. 

TOBY
What is it? 

SAM
I just got a call asking me if I wanted to comment on a story that's gonna run in the 
Georgetown Hoya tomorrow. 

TOBY
The student newspaper? 

SAM
A sociology professor has been teaching what the paper, at any rate, feels is racist 
stuff. Too much funding for Head Start, welfare mothers, and... 

TOBY
And why are they talking to us? 

SAM
Zoey's in the class. 

TOBY
Who cares? 

SAM
This minute? The Georgetown Hoya. Tomorrow...? 

TOBY
The President's daughter got an idiot sociology professor, and we gotta... 

SAM
I'll talk to Zoey. 

TOBY
Please. [long pause] What else? 

SAM
Coveting thy neighbour's wife, for example. How are you going to enforce that one? 

TOBY
Sam! 

SAM
We never have our chats anymore, Toby. 

TOBY
What chats? 

SAM
Our late night chats! 

TOBY
Did we ever do that? 

SAM
[beat] No. 

LEO
[enters] Fellows? 

SAM
Hey. 

LEO
My office. 

Leo walks down the corridor, closely followed by Sam and Toby. 

SAM
Leo, did you know there's a town in Alabama that wants to... 

LEO
Yes. 

SAM
What do you think? 

LEO
Coveting thy neighbour's wife's gonna cause some problems. 

SAM
That's what I said. Plus, if I were arrested for coveting my neighbour's wife, I'd 
probably bear false witness. 

LEO'S OFFICE. Josh is on a chair eating. Leo, Sam and Toby enter.

JOSH
Hey. 

LEO
Josh! This Sex Ed report could not have possibly come at a worse time. 

JOSH
I know. 

LEO
A hundred thousand school teachers... 

JOSH
I know. 

LEO
He's going to sign the hate crimes bill! 

TOBY
He didn't write the thing, Leo. 

LEO
I'm saying I wish we'd have gotten some heads up it was coming, and what was in it. 

TOBY
Well, that horse left the barn! 

LEO
We're going to have to deal with it tomorrow. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

LEO
What else? What's this thing on the Hill? 

JOSH
Sam and me, we're meeting with Bruno from an appropriation sub-committee that has 
jurisdiction over the White House budget. 

LEO
Is this about me? 

JOSH
Technically, it's about me. They want to know why I withheld information gained during 
Inspector Javert's drug search... Yeah, it's about you. 

TOBY
Um... Can I just say a word about that? 

LEO
No. 

TOBY
It was absolutely the right thing to do under the circumstances. 

LEO
I understand. You're going with them? 

SAM
Yeah. 

LEO
Okay. I'm sorry I've made you guys have to... 

SAM
Leo... 

JOSH
Please! 

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Donna, Carol, Cathy, Ginger, and Margaret are huddled and talking. 

DONNA
First of all, you don't know that for sure. 

CATHY
She just said... 

MARGARET
Guys! 

CATHY 
She just said she knew that for sure! 

DONNA
She said, she knew it in her heart, which is very different from someone saying... 

GINGER
I know it for sure. 

CATHY
She just said it. 

CAROL 
Someone needs to tell their boss. 

MRS.LANDINGHAM 
[comes out of the Oval Office] Excuse me. 

MARGARET
Good evening, Mrs Landingham. 

MRS LANDINGHAM 
What are you girls doing? 

MARGARET
We're just... talking, Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You all work for very important people. This is not a place for gossip. You understand me? 

ALL 
Yes Ma'am. 

Mrs. Landingham exits. 

DONNA
She said she knew it in her heart. You know how many things I've been wrong about in 
my heart?

CATHY
Yeah, but she's right about this one. Aren't you? 

JOSH
[comes out of the Oval Office] Well, here's a group of federal employees. [walks]

DONNA
[following Josh] Can I talk to you? 

JOSH
Sure. 

DONNA
In Sam's office? 

JOSH
We'll need to ask Sam, don't you think? 

DONNA
I need Sam, too. 

JOSH
[to Sam, passing] Sam! 

SAM
Yes, sir? 

JOSH
Donna needs to talk to us, and it doesn't look good. 

They begin to walk to Sam's office. 

DONNA
This Vice President's advance man, with the golf clubs and the helicopter? 

JOSH
Chad Magrudian? 

DONNA
Yep. 

JOSH
Didn't he used to work for us? 

SAM
He kept screwing up. 

JOSH
How? 

SAM
He advanced the Puerto Rico trip and spent a half a day scuba diving. Which was nowhere 
on the President's itinerary. He advanced the New York trip and got impossible tickets 
to something that the President had no intention of seeing. 

JOSH
He's working for Hoynes now? 

DONNA
Yeah, just recently. 

SAM
He played 18 holes on Pebble Beach. 

DONNA
Which, technically, is what he's supposed to do. 

SAM
He wasn't supposed to take a Navy helicopter and make it wait. 

JOSH
Well, what does this have to do with us? 

DONNA
We know who leaked the story. 

Josh closes the door to Sam's office. 

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is on her couch reading the report. Toby walks in and sits across her. 

C.J.
Hi. 

TOBY
You remember Chad Magrudian? 

C.J.
The advance man? 

TOBY
Yeah. He took a ride... 

C.J.
I know about this already. The round of golf? 

TOBY
How do you know? 

C.J.
Danny got it from a White House source. 

TOBY
Danny gave it to you? 

C.J.
Any problem with that? 

TOBY
As long as it wasn't the other way round. That was a joke! 

C.J.
It better have been. What else? 

TOBY
C.J.... 

C.J.
What else? 

TOBY
There's going to be a thing with Zoey. Her sociology professor's teaching some things, 
and we're going to get her out of class. 

C.J.
Okay. 

TOBY
You can dump that out with the trash. 

C.J.
Okay. 

TOBY
And I was kidding before. 

C.J.
I don't leak stories to Danny. If you don't believe me, ask Danny. 

TOBY
I do believe you. 

C.J.
Good. 

TOBY
You okay by yourself? 

C.J.
Why wouldn't I be okay? 

TOBY
Okay... Night. 

Toby leaves as C.J. watches him. 

FADE OUT. 
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Toby, Sam and Josh are waiting.

JOSH
Her name is Karen Larsen. She worked on the Vice-President's campaign and in his public 
affairs office. Aides thought she was getting a bit of a crush on Hoynes, so they moved 
her further away. 

TOBY
Where? 

SAM
Glad you asked. 

TOBY
Personnel? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

TOBY
How high is her FBI clearance? 

SAM
High enough. 

JOSH
I think we've found our man. 

TOBY
Sam, have a talk with her when you get back from the Hill. 

SAM
Yeah. 

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and Leo walk in from the PORTICO.

LEO
The way the European Union's set up, the rules favor the import of bananas from Latin 
American countries that used to be European colonies. 

BARTLET
I don't want to spend the whole day talking about bananas. Good morning Nancy, good 
morning Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning Mr President. Did you say you wanted a banana? 

BARTLET
No. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Nancy, run get the President a banana. 

BARTLET
I really don't want a banana. 

NANCY A
Are you sure, Sir? 

BARTLET
Yes, thank you. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
They've got lots of potassium. 

BARTLET
I'm done talking to you now. 

Bartlet and Leo walk in THE OVAL OFFICE where Toby, Sam and Josh are. They stand up. 

BARTLET
Good Morning everyone. Sit down, sit down please. 

LEO
The point they're gonna make is that the rules discriminate against bananas from poorer 
Latin American countries. 

BARTLET
Are we a poor Latin American country? 

LEO
No. 

BARTLET
Then why am I having this conversation? 

LEO
Because the bananas grown in those countries are sold by American companies. 

BARTLET
I'm in trouble with Chiquita and Dole? 

LEO
Well, it's not you so much as... Yeah, it's mostly you. 

BARTLET
Toby. 

TOBY
Yes, sir? 

BARTLET
We have appointed five people to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans 
in the House, as well as an alarming number of Democrats, have been holding up those 
appointments. 

TOBY
I've been fully briefed. 

BARTLET
As far as I can tell, their reluctance has little, if anything, to do with bananas. 

TOBY
I'm meeting with some key people this afternoon. 

BARTLET
You're all set? 

TOBY
I was raised on Sesame Street. I was raised on Julia Child. I was raised on Brideshead 
Revisited. Their legacies are safe in my hands. 

C.J. is standing in the doorway, giggling.

TOBY
[to C.J.] You've got a problem? 

C.J.
[laughing] You watched cooking shows? 

TOBY
I watched Miss Julia Child. 

C.J.
Okay. 

LEO
C.J.? Mandy talk to you about the Lydells? 

C.J.
Yeah. 

BARTLET
You're going to sit with them? 

C.J.
When they get in this afternoon. 

BARTLET
And talk to the father. 

C.J.
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
The mother too, but I'm concerned about the father. 

C.J.
Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what exactly is the nature of your concern? 

LEO
Mandy says he's withdrawn, that he doesn't say much. 

C.J.
I don't understand... His son was just killed. 

LEO
His son was just killed because he was gay. 

C.J.
And...? 

BARTLET
This is no time to out a guy in front and center who's embarrassed that his son was gay. 

C.J.
Really? 

LEO
Fathers and sons, C.J.. This guy sells dental supplies in the Twin Cities, so how 
enlightened do you think he's going to be? 

C.J.
Yeah... but his son just died. 

BARTLET
Sit and talk to them. 

C.J.
Yes, sir. 

LEO
Was that it? 

C.J.
Mr. President, I was wondering if you had an opportunity to look at the Sex Education 
report? 

BARTLET
I haven't had chance yet. 

C.J.
Because it's very dramatic and I think we should talk about the right form with which 
to present it to the public. 

BARTLET
Give me a chance to look it over and we'll talk at the end of the day. 

C.J.
Yes, sir, thank you. 

Everyone starts to leave.

BARTLET
Josh and Sam, wait up a second. Leo, don't go away. [follows Josh and Sam into the hallway]
[to the agent outside] Excuse us a second. Thank you. 

The agent walks off.

BARTLET 
[to Josh and Sam] What time are you going up to the Hill? 

JOSH
Noon. 

BARTLET
I want to pre-empt a hearing. I don't want it. I don't want it for Leo. I don't want 
it for his family. I don't want it for us. They know that, and they're gonna play "Let's 
Make a Deal." Don't take anything off the table until you've talked to me. You understand? 

JOSH
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Okay. Unless a war breaks out, I'll be spending much of my day talking about bananas. 

SAM
Godspeed to you, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you. 

JOSH
Thank you, Mr President. 

BARTLET
Alright. [goes back into the office to join Leo] Is Simon Blye coming in to meet with 
you today? 

LEO
How did you know that? 

BARTLET
I broke into your secret schedule compartment and took infrared photos with my compact 
camera. [sits] 

LEO
Sir... 

BARTLET
Margaret told me. Look, why are you meeting with that man? 

LEO
He's a good friend. 

BARTLET
No, he's not. 

LEO
He's been a good friend to me. 

BARTLET
In good times, Leo. It's not hard to like a guy when he's doing well. The measure of a 
man is, how does he behave when things are otherwise? 

LEO
I need some counsel. 

BARTLET
That you couldn't get from me? Or Toby, or Josh, or Sam, or C.J.? 

LEO
I didn't mean that, Mr. President.. 

BARTLET
I know you... 

LEO
And of course, your counsel is valued above all else. I just meant, I can use all the 
help I can get. 

BARTLET
You put a lot of faith in people, Leo, and I love you for that. I just don't want to 
see you get disappointed. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Especially now. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

LEO
[leaving] Oh, at some point, you've got to read the Sex Ed report. 

BARTLET
I will. 

LEO
Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you.

Danny is typing. C.J. enters. 

C.J.
Hey. 

DANNY
Hey. 

C.J.
Tell me something. 

DANNY
Okay. 

C.J.
Are we off the record? 

DANNY
Sure. 

C.J.
Are we? 

DANNY
Yes. 

C.J.
Feels like we're still on the record. 

DANNY
I don't flick a switch or anything, C.J., we're off the record. 

C.J.
[turning to leave] Never mind. 

DANNY
What was it? 

C.J.
It was nothing. 

DANNY
I want to make it very clear that I have no objection to the kissing. 

C.J.
I understand. 

DANNY
I didn't want you to think it was a problem for me. 

C.J.
There won't be any more kissing. 

DANNY
I'm sorry to hear that. 

C.J.
Is it possible that a father could be embarrassed about his son being gay, even after 
his son was murdered? 

DANNY
Yes. 

C.J.
Possible to the extent that he'd be disinclined to support a law that would impose 
stiffer penalties upon the perpetrators of hate crimes, including the ones who tied 
his 17 year old son to a tree and threw rocks at his head? 

DANNY
Yes. 

C.J.
It eludes me. 

DANNY
I know. 

C.J.
Okay. 

DANNY
Are you going to tell us about the advance guy and the helicopter? 

C.J.
I'll have information for you Friday. 

DANNY
You're gonna dump it in the Friday trash. 

C.J.
He's a C-level aide to the Vice President, Danny. He's resigning. You want to run a 
special section? 

DANNY
Just minding the peoples' business. 

C.J.
A job you're uniquely suited for. 

DANNY
Thank you. 

C.J.
Goodbye. 

DANNY
Okay... [stands face to face with C.J.] See ya. 

C.J.
Okay, you should go now. 

DANNY
I work here. 

C.J.
Yes, then... I should go. 

DANNY
Okay. [watches C.J. leave]

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL - DAY
Josh and Sam are sitting inside a large conference room, opposite Congressman BRUNO and 
two of his aides. 

BRUNO
This isn't a trial, this isn't a deposition, you won't be sworn in, you're not on the 
record. There will be no record. I sit on the House appropriation subcommittee for White 
House budget and management. Many of my colleagues, as you can imagine, are asking that 
hearings be held to determine if there was any wrong-doing on the part of senior White 
House staffers in covering up Leo McGarry's past problems with alcohol and drugs. I want 
to see if we can avoid that, as I'm sure you do as well. 

SAM
Yes, sir. 

BRUNO
So, what happened? 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is sitting at his desk. Margaret walks in. 

MARGARET
Leo? 

LEO
Is he here? 

MARGARET
Yes. 

LEO
Send him in. 

Leo's good friend, SIMON BLYE walks in. Margaret leaves.

SIMON
Leo. 

LEO
Simon. Thanks so much for coming. 

SIMON
Of course. 

LEO
Was there any trouble getting here? 

SIMON
No, no. 

LEO
How's Meredith? 

SIMON
Spending all her time in the country now. 

LEO
Well, you built the house, Simon.

SIMON
[laughs] Well, I know you're busy, Leo. Why don't we talk about you? 

LEO
Okay. 

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL - DAY
Josh and Sam's meeting continues.

SAM
This past November the 21st, Congressman Lillienfield announced, in a sort of reckless 
fashion, that one in three White House staffers was on drugs. 

BRUNO
Yes. 

JOSH
We were in the midst of announcing our nominee for the Supreme Court, so there was a 
certain amount of... 

BRUNO
You didn't want to blow the moment? 

JOSH
Yes. 

BRUNO
You can speak candidly here, Josh. 

JOSH
Thank you. 

BRUNO
Did Toby Ziegler ask you to investigate the claim? 

SAM
'Investigate' is a word that gets us into some trouble. 

BRUNO
Ah. You conducted interviews with staffers to determine... 

JOSH
There's a first clients. 

BRUNO
Right. If there were any staffers using drugs, or if anyone knew of any staffers using 
drugs. 

JOSH
That's right. 

BRUNO
And Claypool subpoenaed the paperwork on the interviews? 

JOSH
Under the Freedom of Information Act. 

BRUNO
Okay. I've got your, er, Claypool deposition here and I want to talk about it for a 
moment. 

SAM
Sure. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

SIMON
Josh Lyman and Sam Seaborn. It's my understanding they're met with Bruno's people right 
now. 

LEO
That's right. 

SIMON
Trying to avoid a hearing? 

LEO
Yeah. 

SIMON
They won't be successful. 

LEO
Josh and Sam are pretty good. And Bruno's a reasonable guy, so... 

SIMON
There's going to be a hearing Leo, and it'll take months and it'll be awful. We're 
gonna hear stories about booze, and pills, and God knows what you did... 

LEO
Simon... 

SIMON
The President's got a budget to pass, he's got to get Mendoza confirmed, and in nine 
months he's got to get a Democratic congress elected. Leo. 

LEO
Simon, did you come here to tell me you think I should resign? 

SIMON
Yeah. 

LEO
I've offered the President my resignation; he won't accept it. 

SIMON
He's blinded by friendship, and he's being foolish, and you should point that out to him. 

LEO
Simon, I'm just taking a guess - is there an op-ed piece coming out that I should know 
about? 

SIMON
In tomorrow's Post. I wanted to let you know as a courtesy as we've been friends for so 
long. I have a copy with me... 

LEO
No, I don't need to see it. I know what it says. For the good of the party, for the good 
of the President, a leading Democrat comes out in the Post and calls for my resignation. 
That probably won't get much attention... 

SIMON
Leo... 

LEO
...and it will definitely not distract from the President's agenda. 

SIMON
Now, hang on a sec... 

LEO
I haven't seen you making the rounds on the Sunday morning talk shows in a while, Simon. 
I'm glad I could help out! 

SIMON
I was hoping this would go differently. 

LEO
Tell me something - where's your grave concern for country, party, and President, when 
you're out whoring for Atlantic Oil? 

SIMON
I'm insulted by that. 

LEO
Well, God, I sure didn't mean to hurt your feelings! 

SIMON
I do not... 

LEO
[standing up, as Simon tries to interrupt] I think you should walk out of here now. 
As a matter of fact, I think you should run. 

Simon stands, and leaves the room.

LEO
Oh God. 

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. CAPITOL HILL - DAY
Sam and Josh are still in the meeting on Capitol Hill with Bruno and his two aides. 

JOSH
For how long? 

BRUNO
After the midterms. 

SAM
That's almost a year. 

BRUNO
Yes, sir. 

JOSH
You want the White House to keep it in a drawer for a year? 

BRUNO
Yes, sir. 

JOSH
Why? 

BRUNO
I don't want the debate. Nobody does. Nobody wants to support it. Nobody wants to oppose 
it. Nobody wants the debate - not until after the midterms. 

JOSH
We put this thing in a drawer for a year and you can guarantee us... 

BRUNO
...that there will be no hearings in the House, yes. 

SAM
The President will never go for it. 

BRUNO
Yes, he will. 

JOSH
Leo McGarry hasn't done anything wrong. Neither has anyone else. The hearings aren't going 
to turn up anything. We're not frightened enough to suppress... 

BRUNO
Oh, stop it. Honest to God. It doesn't matter what the hell the hearings turn up. It's a 
hearing! This one is drugs so it's sexy. This is Geraldo's dream come true. So don't get 
up with me okay? I am throwing you a rope - something I'd like the two of you to remember 
next time you're mouthing off on Face the Nation. You can't get anything done cause House 
Republicans are vindictive. [to aides] This is what happens you put teenagers in the White 
House. [to Sam and Josh] You guys screwed this up from the beginning! You should have been 
there first on McGarry. You should have had the White House counsel's office run the 
internal investigation. You've come remarkably close to perjury in this Claypool deposition. 
I'd like to run hearings on the two of you being stupid. But I don't have that kind of time. 
Here's the phone. I'm sure the President is waiting for your call. Excuse us. 

Bruno and the aides stand up and leave the room. Josh and Sam stay sitting there. 

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby and C.J. are in a meeting with Congressional aides. 

FEMALE AIDE
Toby, your argument isn't with us. We watch PBS. We like PBS. But we also work with 
Congressmen who have constituencies who want to know why the federal government is 
subsidizing television for rich people. 

TOBY
It's not television for rich people. 

MALE AIDE
Oh, Toby... 

TOBY
It's not television for rich people. In fact, the public television audience is a fairly 
accurate reflection of the social and economic make up of the United States. [reading] 
One-quarter of the PBS audience is in households with incomes lower than $20,000 a year. 
Blacks comprise 11% of the public television audience and blacks comprise 11% of the 
commercial television audience. [Carol enters the room and C.J. looks up.] 47% 
of PBS viewers have a high school education or less [Toby looks up as C.J. stands up to 
join Carol in hallway], which is one percent better than the commercial TV audience. 
So what are you talking to me about? 

In the HALLWAY, C.J. talks to Carol. 

C.J.
Are they here? 

CAROL 
They're in the Mural Room. 

C.J.
Why don't you get Mandy? 

CAROL 
Do you know where she is? 

C.J.
She's in the Oval Office having what must be a very comfortable conversation with the 
President. 

Carol smiles and walks down the hall.
 
CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Mandy and the President are in the Oval Office reading the same report. 

BARTLET [reading] 
"The majority of young people move from kissing to more intimate sexual behaviors during 
their teenage years. More than 50 percent engage in petting behavior.'' [to Mandy] That's 
what I think it is, right? 

MANDY
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
"By the age of 14, more than 25 percent have touched a girl's..." I won't say that word. 
[he scribbles on the report then reads silently.] Not going to say that. [scribbles] 

MANDY
Okay. 

BARTLET 
[reading silently] Not going to say that. [scribbles] 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[just enters the room] Excuse me, Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yes? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mandy, the Lydells are waiting in the Mural Room. 

MANDY
Does C.J. know? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
She's waiting outside. 

MANDY
[to Bartlet] Mr. President? 

BARTLET 
Go. 

MANDY
Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET 
Thank you.

Mandy leaves. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Would you like to share what's in that report, sir? 

BARTLET 
With you? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes. 

BARTLET 
No. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
May I ask why not, sir? 

BARTLET 
Because I'd rather not be in therapy for the rest of my life. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Very well, sir. [leaves] 

BARTLET 
[reading silently] I won't say that word. [scribbles] 

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
Mandy and C.J. enter the room. JONATHAN and JENNIFER LYDELL are waiting inside.

C.J.
Mr. and Mrs. Lydell? 

MRS. LYDELL 
Yes. 

C.J.
I'm C.J. Cregg. And you've already met Mandy? 

C.J. and Mandy shake hands with the Lydells. 

MRS. LYDELL 
Yes, how do you do? 

C.J.
Please sit. [They all sit.] We want to thank you for coming such a long way, particularly 
so soon after this unspeakable tragedy. 

MRS. LYDELL 
Well, we're glad to be here. 

C.J.
Mrs. Lydell, that's why we asked to talk to you for a minute. It was Mandy's impression - 
and perhaps it was mistaken - that you and your husband... uh... have some reservations 
about appearing in support of the President. I hate to have to put it so bluntly, but is 
that true? 

MRS. LYDELL 
C.J., we strongly support the hate crimes law the President is signing tomorrow night. 

C.J.
Mr. Lydell? 

MR. LYDELL 
Yes? 

C.J.
I'm sorry. I was asking... Mr. Lydell, I don't know how else to put this. But if you 
appear in front of the press to be at all embarrassed about your son's homosexuality... 
I guess... let me just say this, do you support the President? 

MRS. LYDELL 
Yes, we do. 

MR. LYDELL 
No, we do not. 

MRS. LYDELL 
Jonathan.... 

MR. LYDELL 
No, that was really the last... [Mrs. Lydell tries to protest] No, we do not. The hate 
crimes bill is fine. Who gives a damn? It's fine. I don't care. If you ask me, we shouldn't 
be making laws against what's in a person's head but who gives a damn? I don't understand 
how this President, who I voted for, I don't understand how he can take such a completely 
weak-ass position on gay rights.

MRS. LYDELL 
Jonathan... 

MR. LYDELL
[touches his wife's hand] Gays in the military, same-sex marriage, gay adoption, boards 
of education - where the hell is he? I want to know what qualities necessary to being a 
parent this President feels my son lacked? I want to know from this President, who has 
served not one day in Vietnam - I had two tours in Vietnam. I want to know what qualities 
necessary to being a soldier this President feels my son lacked? Lady, I'm not embarrassed 
my son was gay. My government is. 

Mandy and C.J. look away from the Lydells, apparently uncomfortable. 

MANDY
[to the Lydells] Will you excuse us for a minute? 

C.J. and Mandy walk out to the HALLWAY, closing the door behind them. 

C.J.
Mandy... 

MANDY
We're going to have to send them home. 

C.J.
They'll be fine. 

MANDY
[incredulous] They won't be fine! 

C.J.
Mandy... 

MANDY
You heard the man. This thing is going to be over and the press is going to surround them. 

C.J.
So, the press surrounds them. He says what he says. 

MANDY
[surprised] What are you talking about? 

C.J.
He made a reasonable point. And maybe, given the circumstances, he's got a right. 

MANDY
To talk to reporters on our dime? 

C.J.
Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. 

MANDY
You are the White House press secretary. 

C.J.
They said they support the bill. 

MANDY
C.J.! 

C.J.
[overlapping Mandy] What else... I'm saying... 

MANDY
Get it together! 

C.J.
[beat] Yeah. All right. All right. I know. I know. 

MANDY
We have to tell them. 

C.J.
I know. 

MANDY
I'll go let them know. 

C.J.
No. No, I'll do it. 

MANDY
Okay. 

C.J. opens the door to THE MURAL ROOM, enters and closes the door. 

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR 

FADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby continues his meeting with the Congressional aides.

FEMALE AIDE 
I've got news for you Toby. When PBS claims that a majority of households are weekly 
viewers they use the Nielsen index. That's based on diaries. 

MALE AIDE 
Those results always show vastly higher PBS viewing than the numbers gathered by the 
automated boxes. 

FEMALE AIDE
Why? Because... 

TOBY
Because people want to claim they're more sophisticated than they are. 

FEMALE AIDE
That's right. 

TOBY
Look... 

MALE AIDE 
Wait, wait, hang on. There's one other thing. Product licensing for Big Bird dolls and 
Fuzzy Bear toys? 

TOBY
Fozzy Bear. 

MAN 
Oh, oh whatever. 

TOBY
[with increasing agitation] It's Fozzy Bear, not Fuzzy Bear. 

MAN 
Product licensing for this merchandise brings in over $20 million a year, none of which 
goes to PBS, all of which goes to the show's producer, the Children's Television Workshop. 
Now this is a company whose Chief Executive earns high six figures in salary and benefits 
per year, yet the show is subsidized by taxpayer dollars. 

TOBY
It's a perfectly reasonable complaint. 

WOMAN 
And? 

TOBY
I don't care. 

MAN 
Toby... 

TOBY
We're gonna see to all those things. In the meantime, a time when the public is rightly 
concerned about the impact of sex and violence on TV this administration is gonna protect 
the muppets, we're gonna protect Wall-street Week, we're gonna protect Live from Lincoln 
Center and by god, we are going to protect Julia Childs.

WOMAN 
Toby... 

C.J. knocks on one of the doors. 

TOBY
Hang on.

Toby crosses over to where C.J. is waiting outside. 

C.J.
I got a message you wanted to see me? 

TOBY
I've got good news. 

C.J.
What? 

TOBY
Josh and Sam cut a deal on the hill. No hearing for Leo, he's gonna be out of the woods. 

C.J.
Oh Toby, that's, that's great. 

TOBY
I gotta get back in there. This is just too much fun. 

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
Inside, looking out toward Cathy's desk, Cathy sees something to her right, she crosses 
to Sam's door and knocks. 

CATHY 
Sam? 

SAM
Cathy, there is a small town in Alabama that wants to pass a law saying if I don't honor 
my father I go to jail. What do you think about that? 

CATHY 
How do they know if you're honoring your father or not? 

SAM
Yeah, I think they've overlooked that. 

CATHY 
She's here. 

SAM
Send her in. 

KAREN LARSON, a quiet woman in her 20's, enters, looking apprehensive. 

SAM
[crossing in front of his desk] Are you Karen Larson? 

KAREN
Yes. 

SAM
I'm Sam Seaborn. 

KAREN
I know. 

SAM
[shuts the door with a loud bang] The advance man you ratted out doesn't work for us 
anymore Karen, he works for the Vice President. Kind of screwed yourself there, didn't you? 

KAREN
I didn't... 

SAM
You trying to win one for the Vice President? 

KAREN
I didn't... 

SAM
Were you? 

KAREN
I wasn't... 

SAM
I've got four witnesses, Karen. I've got Ginger in my office, I have a guy from political 
liaison and I have two wire service reporters. Were you trying to protect your boss? 

KAREN
Mr. Seaborn... 

SAM
There are people here that say you've been acting funny. Like you're guilty and you've got 
something to hide. They think you're the one who leaked the story about the advance man. 
I'm thinking something different. 

KAREN
Mr. Seaborn, I had absolutely nothing to do with the reporters finding out... 

SAM
I don't give a damn about the round of golf. I don't give a damn about the helicopter. 
I don't give a damn about the advance man. [Karen looks to the floor] Karen, look at me. 
[pause] Were you the one who leaked Leo McGarry's personnel file to Lillianfield and 
Claypool? 

KAREN
[realization dawning] Oh... 

SAM
What? 

KAREN
Mr. Claypool is a family friend... 

SAM
CATHY! [Cathy opens the door.] Take her back to her office and stand there while she 
cleans out her desk. [walks to the door, then turns over his shoulder to Karen] 
Security's going to throw you out of the building in fifteen minutes [leaves]

Bartlet comes in and approaches Mrs. Landingham. 

BARTLET
Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes sir? 

BARTLET
You're not going to believe this but I think I'd actually like a banana. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'm afraid not sir, no. 

BARTLET
Why not? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You were offered one earlier, sir, and you were snippy. 

BARTLET
I wasn't snippy! 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'm afraid you were, Mr. President. [looking toward the oval office] C.J.'s waiting, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. 

He crosses into THE OVAL OFFICE and shuts the door.

BARTLET
She withholds food from me. 

C.J.
Mr. President, I hate to keep jumping up and down on this, but... 

BARTLET
The sex-ed report. 

C.J.
Yes sir. 

BARTLET
We're gonna leave it alone for a while. 

C.J.
Sir, when you say... 

BARTLET
[busy at his desk] After the midterm elections. 

C.J.
That's a year from now. 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

C.J.
We're gonna stick it in a drawer? 

BARTLET
It's a pretty incendiary report. 

C.J.
You don't think we have an obligation to present the information? 

BARTLET
[crosses out to stand in front of her] It's not gonna play well at a PTA meeting, C.J. 
It says we should be teaching kids to have sex. 

C.J.
It does not, Mr. President, excuse me sir, but it does not. 

BARTLET
Of course it doesn't. But that's how it's going to play. 

C.J.
The report is very direct, sir, it says with holding knowledge about having sex doesn't 
prevent teenagers from having sex, it prevents teenagers from having sex safely. And it 
says offering information about safe sex doesn't increase the rate of sex, it increases 
the rate of protected sex. 

BARTLET
[in a somewhat patronizing tone] C.J. 

C.J.
We commissioned this report, Mr. President. These people are doctors; we asked them a 
question. How can we put it in a drawer just cause we don't think people are going to 
like the answer? 

BARTLET
C.J., getting it through this congress, a body which at the moment, will only give federal 
funding to sex education programs that teach abstinence only. 

C.J.
We have an enormous pulpit from which... 

BARTLET
[raising his voice] And we will avail ourselves of that pulpit but we will do it after 
the midterm elections. 

C.J.
[a pause, realizes] I think I understand. 

BARTLET
I needed to get Leo off the hook, C.J. 

C.J.
It's the deal Josh and Sam made. 

BARTLET
Yes. We'll deal with it after the midterm elections. 

C.J.
I understand. 

BARTLET
[back behind his desk] I was hoping you would. 

C.J.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Umm, several members of the press already know, I think, the report 
came back to us and... 

BARTLET
Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with telling them we got it. I wouldn't make a big deal 
out of it. We got it, we're looking at it, we're studying it. Throw it out with the trash. 

C.J.
Yes sir. 

BARTLET
Thanks, C.J. 

C.J.
Thank you sir. [almost out the door, but stops and turns back to face Bartlet] 
Mr. President? We could all be better teachers. 

BARTLET
I know. 

C.J. leaves, as Bartlet removes his glasses, looking pensive. 

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT 
C.J. is sitting on the back steps leading out of the press area. Danny enters, from the 
back room. 

DANNY
C.J.? 

C.J.
Hi. 

DANNY
What are you doing? 

C.J.
Hmm? 

DANNY
What are you doing? 

C.J.
[thinking] I was... uh.... nothing. 

DANNY
O.K. 

C.J.
Danny? 

DANNY
Mmhmm? 

C.J.
If you call Mr. and Mrs. Lydell in St. Paul and ask them why... 

DANNY
Don't. 

C.J.
Look... 

DANNY
Don't leak me a story. 

C.J.
I wasn't. 

DANNY
I've seen this look on the face of four other press secretaries before you. You've got a 
story in the trash this week that's a story, you want it out there and someone said no. 

C.J.
There all stories this week. 

DANNY
That happens sometimes. 

C.J.
Four other press secretaries and you never took a free lead? 

DANNY
No I always took a free lead. 

C.J.
Then... 

DANNY
Not from you. 

C.J.
Why? 

DANNY
Cause twenty minutes from now you're gonna remember you're a professional and you're not 
gonna like me anymore. 

C.J.
[thinking this over] What makes you think I'll like you now? 

DANNY
I don't know. But as long as you keep grabbing me and kissing me what the hell do I care? 

C.J.
Good point. 

DANNY
If there's a story, I'll find it. 

C.J.
No you won't. 

DANNY
How do you know? 

C.J.
[Standing up] Cause we've gotten very good at this. 

DANNY
Yes, you have. 

C.J.
Yes, we have. 

C.J. heads into the briefing room, Danny follows. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is at his desk watching television. 

CAROL [on T.V.] 
Please, take your seats folks, the press conference will start in two minutes. Please, 
take your seats... 

MARGARET
Leo? 

LEO
Yeah? 

MARGARET
Karen Larson is here. 

LEO
Thanks. 

Leo turns off the T.V. as Margaret leaves. Karen Larson enters, holding a box with her 
personal items. 

LEO
I'm Leo McGarry. 

KAREN
Yes, sir. 

LEO
I wanted to meet you and I wanted you to meet me. 

KAREN
Yes, sir. 

LEO
Would you like to put down your things and talk for a minute? If you don't, I understand. 

Karen places her box on the table and turns back to Leo.

LEO
When you read in my personnel file that I had been treated for alcohol and drug abuse, 
what went through your mind? Karen, it's okay, you can say it. The worst thing I'm 
empowered to do is fire you and I've already done that. 

KAREN
My father drank a lot... 

LEO
[nodding] So did mine. In fact he died from it. He came home late one night very drunk, 
my mother was yelling at him. I'm not sure about what, but I heard the yelling downstairs 
from my bedroom. She came upstairs and he went out to the garage and shot himself in the 
head. 

KAREN
Is that why you drank and took drugs? 

LEO
I drank and took drugs because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic. 

KAREN
How long did it take you to get cured? 

LEO
I'm not cured. You don't get cured. I haven't had a drink or a pill in six and a half 
years, which isn't to say I won't have one tomorrow. 

KAREN
What would happen if you did? 

LEO
I don't know. But probably a nightmare the likes of which both our fathers experienced. 
And me too. 

KAREN
So after six and a half years you're still not allowed to have a drink? 

LEO
The problem is, I don't want a drink, I want ten drinks. 

KAREN
Are things that bad? 

LEO
[laughing slightly] No. 

KAREN
Then why? 

LEO
'Cause I'm an alcoholic. 

KAREN
I don't understand. 

LEO
I know. It's okay. Hardly anyone does. It's very hard to understand. 

KAREN
You're not like what I thought you would be like. 

LEO
You haven't answered my question yet. When you saw my personnel file, when you saw I'd 
been through treatment, what when through your mind? 

KAREN
My father used to... [She falters. It's obvious this is not a subject she's comfortable 
discussing] You have all these important decisions to make in your job, every day, all 
the time, decisions I can't even... people's lives. 

LEO
Karen, what you did caused a lot of problems; for me, for the President, and for a lot of 
people we don't even know. But I'm not sure it wasn't a little bit brave. Did you like 
working at the White House? 

KAREN
Yes, sir. 

LEO
Okay. Then why don't you go unpack your carton and you and I will give each other a second 
chance? 

KAREN
[smiles, then nods] Okay. 

She picks up her box and quietly leaves. Leo pauses, then turns back to the television to 
watch C.J.'s briefing. 

C.J. [on T.V.]
Just a few more quick things, Chad Margrudien has submitted his resignation to the Vice 
President's office putting an end, I hope, to that affair. We expect the President's 
appointees to the Board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting to be confirmed early 
next week. Oh, I have I not here that Jonathan and Jennifer Lydell won't be able to be at 
the bill signing ceremony later this evening. There was some family business that required 
them to go back to St. Paul.

Original Airdate: January 26, 2000, 9:00 PM EST


West Wing S01E14
After the Supreme Court refuses to stay the execution of a Federal prisoner convicted of killing two drug kingpins, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) must decide whether or not to commute his sentence in less than 48 hours, so he calls upon his sagacious childhood priest, Father Thomas Cavanaugh (Karl Malden) for guidance. Meanwhile, even Toby (Richard Schiff) feels the heat over the controversial issue when he hears a sermon on capital punishment from his rabbi, Rabbi Glassman (David Proval). Elsewhere, a hearing-challenged, combative campaign manager, Joey Lucas (Marlee Matlin) demands an audience with the President when her Democratic congressional candidate has purposely been underfunded by his party before the upcoming election to unseat an incumbent.

FADE IN: INT. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT - FRIDAY EVENING
We see the panel of Supreme Court Judges sitting on the bench. One of them is reading a 
verdict in front of three public defenders.

JUDGE
Assuming arguendo that the district court erred in allowing the jury to consider non-
statutory factors that were vague, overbroad or duplicative in violation of the eighth 
amendment such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The application for a stay 
of execution of the sentence of death, presented to the Chief Justice and referred by him 
to the court, is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorary is denied. The petitioner 
is remanded to the federal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, to be executed by lethal 
injection, Monday morning at 12:01 a.m.

At the sound of the gavel, we--

JERRY
It’s over.

P.D. 1
Jerry...

JERRY
It’s over.

P.D. 1
Who’s our guy at the White House?

JERRY
We don’t have a guy at the White House.

P.D. 1
I’m saying who can we call right now?

JERRY
At eight o’clock on a Friday?

Yes.

JERRY
The switchboard operator.

P.D. 1
Jerry, who do we know who’s got the ear of the President?

JERRY
Nobody!

BOBBY

You know Seaborn?

I used to beat him up in high school.

JERRY
You’re kidding me.

BOBBY
No.

P.D. 1
You can call him right now?

BOBBY
Yeah.

P.D. 1
He’ll take the call?

BOBBY
Let’s find out.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Josh had just finished work and is about to leave. He tries to tell Donna that he’s going 
to go.

JOSH
I’m out of here.

DONNA
You’ve got to see Sam.

Josh turns back and walks the other way. Donna joins him into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
I’m seeing Sam, and then I’m out of here.

DONNA
Are you going to behave yourself tonight?

JOSH
It’s a bachelor party.

DONNA
I’m saying...

JOSH
I can hold my liquor.

DONNA
No you can’t.

JOSH
I can drink with the best of them.

DONNA
You can’t drink with any of them, Josh.

JOSH
I’m in politics, okay. I can drink.

DONNA
You have a very sensitive system.

JOSH
I wish you’d stop telling people that. It makes me sound like an idiot.

DONNA
You’re gonna have two drinks and spend the rest of the weekend sleeping it off.

JOSH
And this is the first time in a long time I’ve had the opportunity to spend the weekend 
doing anything but working, is my point.

DONNA
Are there going to be strippers?

JOSH
Nah.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Tell me the truth.

JOSH
There aren’t going to be strippers there. Men don’t like that anymore.

DONNA
Men don’t like naked women anymore?

JOSH
No, we still like naked women a lot. It’s looking at them in a room full of your best 
friends that makes you feel a little...

DONNA
Sleazy?

JOSH
Uncomfortable.

Josh walks up to Sam as he comes out of the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Donna walks away.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Hi.

JOSH
I’m out of here. What do you need? [They start walking.]

SAM
[calls to office in general] What do I need?

BONNIE
O’Dwyer.

SAM
Yes. I need you to do me a favor.

JOSH
On O’Dwyer?

SAM
His people are calling. They want to know what’s going on.

JOSH
Who’s his people?

SAM
A campaign manager. A guy named Joey Lucas.

JOSH
Never heard of him.

SAM
Me neither.

JOSH
What’s he like?

SAM
I didn’t speak with him. I spoke with his assistant. 

JOSH
What’s the favor?

SAM
I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow with him to try to figure out what’s going on.

JOSH
Aren’t you going sailing tomorrow?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Then how are you gonna... [light dawns] Oh, come on!

SAM
Ten minutes.

They had gone back to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

JOSH
On a Saturday!

SAM
Well, do you have plans?

JOSH
I was planning on doing nothing.

SAM
Ten minutes, fifteen minutes tops.

JOSH
Sam...

SAM
He’s going to be very excited to meet with you. Joshua Lyman, Deputy Chief of Staff. 
He can hear it from the horse’s mouth.

JOSH
What am I supposed to tell him?

SAM
On O’Dwyer?

JOSH
Yeah.

Donna walks up.

SAM
Tell him the truth.

JOSH
I don’t think so. What else you got?

DONNA
What time?

SAM
10:00 tomorrow morning.

DONNA
[to Josh] You have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

JOSH
We have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

DONNA
Why me?

JOSH
‘Cause you work for me.

DONNA
[pouts] I have things to do tomorrow morning, Josh. It was my Saturday too.

JOSH
What things?

DONNA
I have to go shopping.

JOSH
For what?

DONNA
Whatever! It’s Saturday.

JOSH
Ten minutes. When it’s over I’ll buy you some shoes. 

DONNA
[smiles] Really? [leaves]

JOSH
I’m out of here.

SAM
I’m bringing back the Cup, man.

JOSH
Sam, just stay in the boat this time and I’m a happy guy.

SAM
Okay.

JOSH
Good luck. [walks off]

SAM
[shouting after Josh] I’ve got foul weather gear.

JOSH
[shouts back] See you later.

Bonnie is getting ready to leave. So is Sam. They start to put on their jackets.

SAM
Bonnie, I’m done?

BONNIE
You’re done.

SAM
I’m cutting the cord, Bonnie. I’m gonna be unreachable for the weekend.

BONNIE
Good.

SAM
Not taking my pager. [puts it on desk] Not taking my cell phone. [puts it next to pager]

BONNIE
You’ve earned it!

SAM
Out on the ocean blue. Totally cut off from the White House.

BONNIE
It’ll be good for you.

SAM
[to himself] I’m taking my pager. [sticks it in his coat pocket] Should probably take my 
cell phone too. [picks it up] No. No. Cutting the cord. [puts it down] Not taking the cell 
phone. [pulls pager out and puts it on desk] Not taking the pager.

BONNIE
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

BONNIE
You need to relax.

SAM
Yeah.

BONNIE
Have a good weekend.

SAM
You too.

Bonnie leaves. The phone rings as Sam is leaving. He looks at it, then shuts off the 
light and closes the door behind him. The phone rings some more before Sam comes back 
in and picks it up. 

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT
Sam and BOBBY ZANE, one of the public defenders, are walking through.

SAM
Is he guilty?

BOBBY
That’s not the point.

SAM
Is he guilty?

BOBBY
Sam.

SAM
Bobby, is he guilty?

BOBBY
In ‘94 Justice Blackmun officially went on record...

SAM
Bobby!

BOBBY
It was a drug cartel. He killed two kingpins.

SAM
You want me to argue it was a public service measure? 

BOBBY
Sam, I’m not talking about a couple of schoolgirls.
 
SAM
Blackmun’s in support of the death penalty.

BOBBY
I tell you he reversed himself in ‘94. “From this day forward,” he said, “I no longer 
shall tinker with the machinery of death.”

SAM
Yes.

BOBBY
“I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty 
experiment has failed.”

SAM
You don’t have to quote Harry Blackmun with me.

BOBBY
You are going to go to the President, and you’re gonna tell him he can’t run from this 
one. He’s got to consider my client. You’re gonna tell him that.

SAM
I don’t talk to the President that way, Bobby. Nobody talks to the President that way. 
And I’m gonna tell you not that many people talk to me that way anymore.

BOBBY
I’ve got a guy 48 hours away from death. You’re gonna make this personal?

SAM
How long you been with the P.D.’s office?

BOBBY
About two years.

SAM
I heard you were at Ross-Lipton.

BOBBY
Yeah, I was.

SAM
What happened?

BOBBY
They gave me a partnership and a corner office, Sam. What do you think happened?

SAM
The President’s very serious about the separation of powers.

BOBBY
Yeah, but so’s the Constitution. In Article 2, Section 2 says, “He shall have the power 
to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.”

SAM
Thanks for pointing that out. I’m saying the judicial branch has spoken, so why should...?

BOBBY
Oh, that’s what he’s going to hide behind?

SAM
The President’s not hiding behind anything. Right now the President’s on Air Force One 
coming back home from Stockholm. 

BOBBY
So when does he land?

SAM
Around 9:00 a.m.

BOBBY
That’s when you’re going to talk to him?

SAM
Well, I won’t be here tomorrow morning, but I’ll ask Toby Ziegler to talk...

BOBBY
Where are you going?

SAM
Bobby.

BOBBY
Sam.

SAM
I’ll pass it up to Toby Ziegler. He’ll ask for a few minutes of the President’s time, 
but I have to be honest with you. After a long trip...

BOBBY
He’ll talk to the President first thing in the morning?

SAM
Well, it’s Saturday. I think Toby will probably be at temple first thing in the morning.

BOBBY
What temple?

SAM
Bobby.

BOBBY
What temple?

SAM
I don’t know the name of the temple.

BOBBY
You know where it is?

SAM
[caught off guard] I think it’s on Delaware.

BOBBY
Thank you. 

Sam is a little surprised after Bobby quickly walks away.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam returns to his office to grab his bag.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leo comes out of the Roosevelt Room. Sam sees him behind. They walk together.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
I thought you left.

SAM
I just came back to get my bag.

LEO
What’s going on?

SAM
They denied the appeal.

LEO
Simon Cruz.

SAM
Yeah.

LEO
I thought they were sending it back to the...

SAM
Me too.

LEO
No, our guy said they were going to send it back to the sixth circuit.

SAM
Well they didn’t. The denied the appeal five-three.
 
LEO
That’s not what was supposed to happen.

SAM
We’ve got the get Mendoza on the Bench.

LEO
Come on.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
If Mendoza was on the bench, they would have lost five-four. So what are we talking about?

SAM
The execution is scheduled...

LEO
What? 

They reach LEO’S OFFICE.

SAM
The execution is scheduled for 12:01 Monday morning, so the ball’s in our court.

LEO
I’m not sure the President wants the ball in our court. 

SAM
Well, that makes two of us.

LEO
Have a good weekend.

SAM
You’re not gonna...

LEO
He lands at 9:00 tomorrow morning. I’ll let him sleep a little bit then I’ll talk it 
through with him.

SAM
I can brief Toby before I leave.

LEO
Right.

SAM
I’ll see you later. [starts to leave]

LEO
Sam.

SAM
Yeah? [turns back]

LEO
Why Monday morning?

SAM
What do you mean?

LEO
The court denied the appeal. Why isn’t he being executed at midnight tonight?

SAM
We don’t execute people between sundown Friday and sundown Sunday.

LEO
Why?

SAM
Hard as it is to believe...

LEO
[figures it out for himself] You’re kidding me.
 
SAM
No.

LEO
We don’t execute people on the Sabbath.

SAM
No.

LEO
Well, that’s about the most bizarre thing I’ve ever heard.

SAM
Leo, I think you’re gonna find as you go through this weekend that there’s virtually no 
part of this discussion that isn’t bizarre. I’m gonna go home now. I got to race in the 
morning. [leaves]

LEO
[calls after Sam] Hold on to a rope or something, would you.

SAM
Yeah.

Sam leaves. The camera closes on Leo.

LEO
Damn it.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - NIGHT
Sam goes to sign out. He picks up the pen and thinks. He changes his mind and heads back.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam sets down his bag, pulls a book off the shelf and sits down at his desk. He turns on 
the light, puts on his glasses and starts reading.

FADE TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
SATURDAY, 9:00 A.M.
Donna arrives. She puts down her bag and hangs her jacket. She opens the door to JOSH’S 
OFFICE. She finds Josh lying on the floor in front of his desk in disgustingly dirty 
clothes, snoring.

DONNA
Josh. 

Josh snores. 

DONNA
Josh!

Josh, sputtering, wakes up and sits up, blinking. He is very obviously hung over, and 
has a pair of lacy red panties around his neck.

JOSH
Hi.

DONNA
What are you doing?

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Did you spend the night here?

JOSH
No. Just since a couple of hours ago.

DONNA
The party went to morning?

JOSH
Yup.

DONNA
Why didn’t you go home?

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Why didn’t you go home after the party?

JOSH
I couldn’t find my keys, or remember where I lived. [pulls the panties off over his head]

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
I think there might have been strippers there. [gets up]

DONNA
[yells] Oh my God! 

Josh shushes her. 

DONNA
What happened to your clothes?

JOSH
I may have wrinkled my suit.

DONNA
Josh!

JOSH
Donna. You... You really want to speak very softly.

DONNA
How did you get like this?

JOSH
People were pouring champagne over each other.

DONNA
And then wrestling in dirt?

JOSH
I can’t remember, but it’s certainly not out of the question.

DONNA
You have a meeting.

JOSH
Yeah, I know. I’m not, you know. Uh... what was the meeting again?

DONNA
Joey Lucas about O’Dwyer.

JOSH
Yes. [puts on his suit jacket.]

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
I’m fine.

DONNA
You can’t wear those clothes. [holds her nose]
 
JOSH
I’m fine.

DONNA
Trust me.

JOSH
They’re the only clothes I got.

DONNA
I’ll find some other clothes.

JOSH
Fine. [sits in his chair as Donna starts to leave]

DONNA
Are you going to listen to me from now on? 

JOSH
[under breath] I’m not even listening to you now.

DONNA
[shouts] I said, are you going to listen...

JOSH
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Donna leaves and Josh slumps forward onto his desk.

CUT TO: EXT. ANDREW'S AIR FORCE BASE - DAY
Leo gets out of a limousine. He walks toward Bartlet, C.J. and Charlie as they come off 
of Air Force One.

BARTLET
C.J., look...

C.J.
Don’t start with me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.

C.J.
I’m back in America now, I have rights. I’m no longer belted down next to the passenger 
from hell.

LEO
[walks up] Welcome back, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Leo! What’re you doing here?

LEO
I needed a minute, sir. How was the flight?

C.J.
It was --

BARTLET
Great!

C.J.
-- gruesome. “If you’ll look out the left side of the cabin, you’ll see the fjords.” 
Then we got a history of the fjords. Then we got a quiz on the fjords. 
[to Bartlet] Do you have any idea how much I would like to dress you up in lederhosen 
and drop kick you into the fjords right now?

BARTLET
Aww. You don’t know how to have fun when we’re traveling...

C.J. and Bartlet get into the car.

CHARLIE
[quietly to Leo] It was quite a trip. [gets into car]

LEO
[under breath] It ain’t over yet.

He gets into the limousine. C.J. sneezes as they drive off.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Donna walks into Josh's office with bright yellow hip-waders in one hand and a cup in 
the other.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Huh.

DONNA
Here. [puts foul weather gear on desk]

JOSH
What’s that?

DONNA
It’s Sam’s foul weather gear. Drink this. [puts cup on desk]

JOSH
Coffee?

DONNA
It’s strong. Drink it all. 

Donna walks out. Josh drinks, gags, and lets the coffee run out of his mouth down the 
front of his shirt.

JOSH
Blah.

DONNA
[comes back in] It’s from yesterday, so it might not be hot anymore.

JOSH
What time is this person coming?

DONNA
Forty minutes. Put this on. [indicates hip-waders]

JOSH
I’m not wearing that.

DONNA
There’s a one-hour cleaners on Connecticut.

JOSH
He’s getting here in forty minutes.

DONNA
Zuzu will do it in half an hour.

JOSH
Who’s Zuzu?

DONNA
The guy from the dry cleaners, Josh. Change your clothes!

JOSH
His name is Zuzu?

DONNA
Change your clothes.

JOSH
I’ll look like the Gorton’s fisherman in this thing. [gets up and starts to change]

CUT TO: INT. JEWISH SYNAGOGUE - DAY
People sit down as the rabbi starts his sermon. We see Toby in the crowd.

RABBI
With Passover on the horizon, millions of Jews will gather round Seder tables, will sing 
our songs and ask our questions. 

Toby's beeper suddenly goes off. People look at him.

RABBI [cont.]
About the stick that beat the dog that bit the cat that ate the kid. 

Toby checks his beeper, then gets up and works his way out of the row and walks to the 
back while the rabbi continues.

RABBI [cont.]
We’ll sing not only to entertain our children but to be reminded by the Haggadah, the 
simple truth. That violence begets violence. Vengeance is not Jewish. We’ll pour ten 
drops...

CUT TO: INT. SYNAGOGUE ENTRANCEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Toby gets to the entranceway and pulls out his cell phone, dials. 

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
The phone rings and Sam answers it.

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

TOBY
What do you want?

SAM  
How ya doing?

TOBY
Sam, I’m at temple right now.

SAM
Yeah, by any chance is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment?

TOBY 
What?

SAM
Is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment? 

Toby puts his cell phone to his shoulder and listens to the rabbi.

RABBI
No matter how deep our desire to witness the sufferings of our enemies, we are commanded 
to relocate our humanity. Vengeance is not Jewish. We are commanded to relocate...

TOBY
[puts the phone back to his ear] Yeah, he is. How did you know that?

SAM
I’ll explain it to you when you get over here.

TOBY 
Why am I coming over there?

SAM
The appeal was denied.

TOBY
All right, I’m on my way.

Toby puts his phone away. Just as we hear the rabbi say “quietly,” he leans slightly 
against a stack of folded metal chairs and then watches in horror as they slide to the 
floor in a horrendous crash.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
A man and a woman burst in, to find Josh in an undershirt and the hip-waders. JOEY LUCAS, 
a deaf campaign manager is signing and her assistant, KENNY THURMAN is translating.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you the unmitigated jackass who has the DNC choking off funding for the O’Dwyer 
campaign in the California forty-sixth?

JOSH
[bleary] What is God’s name is happening right now?

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m Joey Lucas.

JOSH
[to Kenny] You’re Joey Lucas?

Kenny looks at Joey, then back at Josh.

JOEY [KENNY]
No, I’m Joey Lucas.

JOSH
Help me, ‘cause I... I don’t...

JOEY
[yells] You idiot. I’m. Joey. Lucas.

JOSH
Ah. [pause] Ah, okay. I’m Josh Lyman.

JOEY [KENNY]
I know who you are.

JOSH
You’re Joey Lucas.

JOEY [KENNY]
What were you expecting?

JOSH
A man.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m a woman.

JOSH
You’re O’Dwyer’s campaign manager? 

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes, and I have three sources, two at the DNC... 

Josh stands up. 

JOEY
What the hell are you wearing?

JOSH
Me?

JOEY
Yes.

JOSH
[looks down at himself] I was... I uh... I... I spilt some things on my clothes. Tell 
you what, let’s... let’s just take a deep breath for a second while I try and remember, 
you know, where I am right now.

Josh walks around the desk, obviously to within smelling distance of Joey, who covers her 
nose.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you drunk?

JOSH
I have a very delicate system.

JOEY [KENNY]
Okay, look, I’m totally serious about this. I’m trying to get a guy elected to Congress. 
It’s gonna be a very tight race and I want to know why the White House is screwing around 
with me.

DONNA
[comes to the door, holding Josh's suit] Excuse me.

JOSH
Thank God.

DONNA
What’s going on?

JOSH
[to Joey] This is my assistant, Donna Moss. Donna, Joey Lucas.

DONNA
[to Joey] Hi.

JOSH
I’m just going to go... I... I... I’m... I’m gonna go change my clothes. I’ll... I’ll be 
right back. 

Josh and Donna walk out to the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Took you long enough.

DONNA
I got stuck at Dupont Circle again.

JOSH
You have any idea how dumb I looked in there?

DONNA
So Joey Lucas is a woman.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
And she’s deaf.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Cool.

JOSH
Give me those. 

He takes the clothes and heads into a room while Donna stays outside.

DONNA
You need to go see Sam.

JOSH
What’s Sam doing here?

DONNA
He told me to tell you the appeal was denied.

JOSH
What are you talking about?

DONNA
All he said was “The appeal was denied.”

JOSH
[nickel drops] Oh, man. Make sure they’re going to be okay in there. This might take a 
few minutes.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Sam and Mandy are doing research. Toby is just standing there, looking at Sam.

TOBY
Are you saying my rabbi wrote a sermon just for me? 

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
How did he know what was going on here?

SAM
One of the public defenders, guy named Bobby Zane...

TOBY
One of the public defenders spoke to my rabbi?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
How did he know where I go to temple? How did he know I even go to temple?

JOSH
[comes in, tucking in his shirt] I thought they were sending it back to the sixth circuit.

TOBY
I thought so too.

JOSH
Where’s the President?

SAM
He’s in the residence.

JOSH
Are we getting a briefing from Justice?

SAM
He’ll be here in a minute.

JOSH
When’s the execution?

SAM
Sunday, 12:01.

MANDY
Monday, 12:01.

SAM
Minute after midnight tomorrow.

JOSH
Lethal injection?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
[looks at Josh in disgust] Josh, you sleep in a dumpster last night?

JOSH
Possibly. [to Sam] Hey, why aren’t you sailing right now?

SAM
I stayed.

MANDY
Is there any evidence that capital punishment serves as a deterrent?

SAM
Speculative evidence at best.

MANDY
What are the stats on federal executions and the President stepping in?

SAM
‘63 was the last execution.

MANDY
Who was the last President to commute the sentence? 

JOSH
Lincoln.

MANDY
Abraham?

JOSH
No, Bert Lincoln. Mandy, what are you-?

MANDY
I’m asking. I’m surprised.

JOSH
I don’t want a debate on the death penalty. Let’s get some stuff together and get ready
for the President.

MANDY
I’m gonna start working with C.J. [leaves] 

JOSH
I gotta get back to... [starts to leave] Oh... By the way, Sam. Joey Lucas is waiting 
for me in my office right now.

SAM
Well, what’s he like?

JOSH
Well, for a campaign manager, he’s got very nice legs.

SAM
He’s a woman?

JOSH
Yes. He is. He’s also deaf. And very pissed. Be right back. [leaves]

TOBY
[looking pissed] Sam.

SAM
You know there’s room to give the President some judicial cover if he wants to commute.

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
This guy was convicted of three murders by a Mexican court. Does that matter to us? 
During the penalty phase, the trial judge let the prosecutor introduce the evidence 
of the Mexican convictions.

TOBY
I know.

SAM
Well, the Mexican courts are ridiculous, Toby. That never should have...

TOBY
How did the public defender know I was at that temple?

SAM
I’m saying, this guy didn’t have the world’s greatest legal council.

TOBY
How did he know where I was going to be?

SAM
I told him.

TOBY
You told him.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Sam, what’re you doing giving out that kind of information-

SAM
I know. I don’t know. Right at that moment it seemed like what I should do.

TOBY
He’s not going to commute the sentence, Sam.

SAM
We don’t know what the President’s gonna do.

TOBY
It seemed like what you should do?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - DAY
Bartlet is dressing up. Leo is briefing him.

LEO
So, anyway, he was tried and found guilty four years ago in the district court in 
Michigan. And the sixth circuit turned down his appeal. The Supreme Court gave him 
a stay, heard the case, turned him down five-three.

BARTLET
We got to get Mendoza on the bench.

LEO
Well, that’s Monday’s problem. Your problem’s today. 

BARTLET
Why is it my problem at all?

LEO
As opposed to who?

BARTLET
The governor of Michigan.

LEO
Oh, you mean, why isn’t it a state crime.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
It was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney under the ‘88 drug kingpin law that was modified 
into the ‘94 omnibus crime bill. 

BARTLET
Which allows for the death penalty in certain drug related homicides.

LEO
Well, basically. The deputy AG’s office is putting together a briefing for you.

BARTLET
How long?

LEO
About an hour.

BARTLET
Okay, I’ll wait for that then.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I’m gonna want to see our people over the next few days.

LEO
Everyone’s here now or on their way.

BARTLET
I’m not going to be very good at this, Leo.

LEO
Well, you’ll be joining a pretty big club, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah. [calls] Charlie!

LEO
I’ll call you when the guys have put something together. 

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

CHARLIE
[comes in] Yes sir.

BARTLET
Charlie, there’s a priest in Hanover. His name is Thomas Cavanaugh. He’s at the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary. I’d like to arrange to have him come down and spend some 
time with me this weekend. Very important that the White House not pay for this. This 
is my nickel.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And I’m gonna want to... [stops]

CHARLIE
I’m sorry, sir?

BARTLET
No. No, never mind. [pause] Yeah. I’m gonna want to talk to the Pope.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[gets up and walks over to Charlie] I’m gonna ask you a question. And this is one of 
those times that it’s okay to tell me I’ve stepped over the line, and I should shut 
my mouth, okay. 

CHARLIE
Okay.

BARTLET
What happened to the guy who shot your mother?

CHARLIE
They haven’t found him yet sir.

BARTLET
If they did, would you wanna see him executed? 

Charlie just looks at him. 

BARTLET
Killing a police officer’s a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And?

CHARLIE
I wouldn’t want to see him executed, Mr. President --

Bartlet nods.

CHARLIE
-- I’d wanna do it myself.

BARTLET
[looks thoughtful] Yeah.

CHARLIE
I’ll get the ball rolling on these arrangements. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is back in his meeting.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m running a campaign against a Conservative Republican who’s held his seat for 
over thirty years. He opposed gay rights, abortion, gun control, and raising the 
minimum wage. And supports government sponsored prayer in the schools and amending 
the Bill of Rights to prohibit burning an American flag. Now for the first time in 
three decades, we have a chance to beat him. Why are you telling the DNC to cut 
down my funding?

JOSH
Because you have a chance to beat him.

JOEY [KENNY]
Excuse me?

JOSH
We’ve been watching your campaign. You’re doing way too well.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you deranged?

JOSH
He’s a preposterous figure. We want to keep him right where he is.

JOEY [KENNY]
You mean you want to keep him on as a poster boy for the Radical Right?

JOSH
Joey, every time he comes out with one of his declarations about brown people crossing 
the border, the DNC slaps it into a direct mail campaign, and he’s good for two or 
three million dollars.

JOEY [KENNY]
I want to speak to the President.

JOSH
[laughs] No problem.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m perfectly serious.

JOSH
The President doesn’t take meetings on this level. I don’t even take meetings on 
this level!

JOEY [KENNY]
What level is that?

JOSH
Joey. [walks to the door]

JOEY [KENNY]
You can be afraid of me, pal. I can create problems for you, you’ve never even heard of.

JOSH
I’m not hearing a lot of party loyalty from you here, Joey.

JOEY [KENNY]
Well, maybe if your head wasn’t so far up your...

JOSH
Hey!

JOEY
I want to speak to the President!

JOSH
[shouting] Hey, Lunatic Lady! Trust me when I tell you that there’s absolutely no way 
that you are going to see the President!

BARTLET
[walks up] Hey, Josh.

JOSH
Hello, Mr. President. Welcome back.

BARTLET
How are you?

JOSH
Well, I’d like this day to be over pretty bad.

BARTLET
Who are your friends?

JOSH
Uh, this is Joey Lucas.

BARTLET
[to Joey] How are you?

JOEY
Honored to meet you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

JOSH
[indicates Kenny] And this is Kenny... somebody.

BARTLET
Hi, Kenny.

KENNY
Thurman.

JOSH
We were just finishing up.

BARTLET
I was just wandering the halls and thinking.

JOSH
Why don’t you let me show these people off and, uh, I can wander the halls with you.

BARTLET
[to Joey] You ever seen the White House?

JOEY
No sir.

BARTLET
Let’s take a walk.

JOSH
Sir.

BARTLET
Come on.

Joey looks triumphant as she follows Bartlet out the office.

JOSH
Yes sir.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Carol are walking through the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE towards C.J.’S OFFICE.

C.J.
Carol. Good. I need biographical information on Simon Cruz.

CAROL
Is it C-R-U-Z?

C.J.
I don’t know.

CAROL
What kind of biographical information?

C.J.
Gonna need to know how to spell his name for sure. 

They head down the hall as the camera follows Bartlet and Joey, who are trailed by 
Josh and Kenny.

BARTLET
Do you read lips?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Joey?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Is that short for Joanne?

JOEY
Josephine.

BARTLET
And your last name is Lucas?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Is that Polish?

JOEY
Dutch.

BARTLET
Protestant?

JOEY
Quaker.

They walk into THE OVAL OFFICE. Joey is completely in awe.

BARTLET
Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down. 

He sits on chair, with Joey and Kenny on the opposite couch. Josh stands by the door. 

BARTLET
Well, where did you go to school?

JOEY [KENNY]
UCLA and Stanford.

BARTLET
There’s a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He’s going to be executed in about 36 
hours. What do you think I should do? 

JOEY [KENNY]
[thinks] Stay the execution.

BARTLET
Why?

JOEY [KENNY]
Because the state shouldn’t kill people.

BARTLET
He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.

JOEY [KENNY]
Send him to prison.

BARTLET
You’re against capital punishment.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thomas Aquinas?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Two pretty smart guys, right?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, “Who sheddeth a man’s 
blood by man shall his blood be shed.”

JOEY [KENNY]
And Immanuel Kant said that the death penalty is a categorical imperative. But, Mr. 
President, those writings are from other centuries.

BARTLET
I’ve got a Harris poll says seventy-one percent of the American people support capital 
punishment.

JOEY [KENNY]
That’s a political problem.

BARTLET
I’m a politician.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

Bartlet looks up at Josh, who gets the idea.

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President. We should... [gestures to the door]

Everyone stands. Bartlet turns to walk to his desk, but Joey reaches out to get his 
attention.

JOEY
Excuse me.

JOEY [KENNY]
Mr. President, I’m here ‘cause I’m running a campaign for Bill O’Dwyer, who’s running...

BARTLET
In the California forty-sixth?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
O’Dwyer’s an empty shirt.

JOEY [KENNY]
Sir?

BARTLET
I don’t like guys who run for congress because they think it’s a great gig. Find 
yourself a live one and I’ll get interested. In the meantime, the devil you know 
beats the devil you don’t. And I like the devil I got.

JOEY [KENNY]
But, sir...

BARTLET
Josh will take care of you from here.

Joey and Kenny pass Josh as they leave the room and continue walking.

JOEY [KENNY]
We’re going back to the hotel.

KENNY
It was nice meeting you.

JOSH
[to Joey] Nice to meet you.

KENNY
That was me saying that.

JOSH
[to Joey] You didn’t have a good time meeting me?

Joey gives him the “universal sign.” 

JOSH
You know what, I actually know that sign. 

Joey spells out something else and leaves, followed by Kenny.

JOSH
Don’t know that one, but I can probably guess.

CUT TO: INT. JEWISH SYNAGOGUE - DAY
SUNDAY MORNING, 9:10 A.M.
A singer is walking down the aisle in the synagogue with her accompanist.

SINGER
I just want to go through this piece a few times.
 
The camera moves to RABBI GLASSMAN, who is sitting in a pew. Toby walks up from behind him.

TOBY
Rabbi Glassman.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Toby. I didn’t hear you, which is fairly unusual. 

TOBY
[chuckles] Yeah. [sits on a pew behind the rabbi]

RABBI GLASSMAN
You missed the end of my sermon yesterday.

TOBY
Yeah, well, I had to go back to my office and I think you know why.

RABBI GLASSMAN
A lawyer named Bobby Zane called me Friday night. He told me what was happening. 
He asked if I had any influence in Toby Ziegler. I told him clearly he hadn’t spent 
any time with Toby Ziegler.

The singer starts her song in the background.

TOBY
Um? [gestures to singer]

RABBI GLASSMAN
Oh. I’m having a funeral service in the morning. She’s practicing a piece.

TOBY
That’s funny.

RABBI GLASSMAN
What?

TOBY
I never imagined the practicing.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Day and night.

TOBY
Rabbi. You - and Bobby Zane - what were you expecting of me when you gave your sermon 
yesterday?

RABBI GLASSMAN
Well, I suppose it was some hope you might take the Sabbath day to consider your 
position.

TOBY
As Communications Director, uh, I’m a counselor to the President to be sure. But my 
role in these situations is generally... I create a public face for what... I don’t 
influence policy.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Of course you do.

TOBY
You want me to go into the Oval Office and say, “Vengeance is not Jewish”?

RABBI 
[shrugs] Why not?

TOBY
Well, for one thing, neither is the President!

RABBI GLASSMAN
You can say all you want about the Catholic Church, but their position on life is 
unimpeachable. No abortion, no death penalty.

TOBY
Look, I... I spent the day...

RABBI GLASSMAN
You spent the day hoping the President wouldn’t call the Pope.

TOBY
You’re damn right. I did.

RABBI GLASSMAN
If he had commuted the sentence after talking to the Pope, the worst fears of every 
non-Catholic who voted for him would be realized. 

Both chuckle.

TOBY
Congratulations, Rabbi Glassman, you may now join the White House communications staff.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Look, Toby, you look like you’re having a long weekend. I appreciate the courtesy of 
you stopping by. 

TOBY
Yeah, well, you’re welcome. [Both get up.] The Torah doesn’t prohibit capital punishment.

RABBI GLASSMAN
No.

TOBY
It says, “An eye for an eye.”

RABBI GLASSMAN
You know what it also says? It says a rebellious child can be brought to the city gates 
and stoned to death. It says homosexuality is an abomination and punishable by death. 
It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking 
reflected the best wisdom of its time, but it’s just plain wrong by any modern standard. 
Society has a right to protect itself, but it doesn’t have a right to be vengeful. It 
has a right to punish, but it doesn’t have to kill.

TOBY
You know what I think? I think you knew I was coming back here. And I think you put her 
there on purpose. [gestures to singer]

RABBI GLASSMAN
She’s our communications director.

TOBY
[chuckles] Yeah. Well, anyway. 

RABBI GLASSMAN
Shalom, Toby.

TOBY
Shalom, Rabbi. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is sitting in her office, looking at a picture of three children playing. She 
is obviously bothered by something. Mandy comes in.

MANDY
C.J.

C.J.
Yeah.

MANDY
You have everything you need?

C.J.
Yeah.

MANDY
I mean for a briefing.

C.J.
I have his biographical information. His mother’s name is Sophia. Sophia.

MANDY
You’re gonna need more than that.

C.J.
I have more than that.

MANDY
Okay. [starts to leave]

C.J.
You know, I have no position on capital punishment. I try to get worked up about it, 
it seems like I should. But the truth is, I honestly don’t care if Simon Cruz lives 
or dies. And I suppose if it brings some measure of comfort to the families of the 
victims, then why the hell not.

MANDY
That’s valid.

C.J.
So, here’s my job tonight. If this thing happens. [opens a folder, puts on glasses 
and starts to read] “At 12:01, he’ll get the injection...”

MANDY
C.J. [comes next to C.J.’S desk]

C.J.
No, I’m saying, I’m reading it, right here. “The first sign of death will be his hands 
twitching. After sixty seconds, he’ll strain against the straps, his head will have 
snapped back violently, and after ninety seconds he’ll be in convulsions. At 12:04, 
he’ll be pronounced dead.”

MANDY
He killed two people, probably more. I’m sorry. I don’t get worked up over it.

C.J.
Me neither. That’s what I’m saying, me neither. Except... at 12:04, ‘cause that’s when 
the warden calls me. That’s my job tonight. I have to go in and tell the President that 
Simon Cruz is dead and we’re the ones who killed him. So... 
[pause] I just wish I didn’t know his mother’s name was Sophia, is all I’m saying. 

MANDY
[beat]
Okay.

Mandy leaves. C.J. continues to stare into space, looking even more upset.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
SUNDAY, 6:15 P.M.
Bartlet is sitting at his desk, reading. Nancy comes in.

NANCY
Mr. President, Toby’s here.

BARTLET
Okay.

TOBY
[comes in] Good afternoon, sir. Welcome back. 

BARTLET
Thank you.

TOBY
How was your trip?

BARTLET
Fine. What do you need?

TOBY
I had a strange experience this weekend. One of the P.D.s on the Cruz case, I guess 
trying the things you do when you’re desperate, he went and spoke to my rabbi.

BARTLET
Jewish law doesn’t prohibit...

TOBY
I know.

BARTLET
The commandment does not say, “Thou shalt not kill.” It says, “Thou shalt not murder.”

TOBY
I know. But the fact is that, even two thousand years ago, the rabbis of the Talmud 
couldn’t... [tries to find the right word] ...stomach it. I mean, they weren’t about 
to rewrite the Torah, but they came up with another way. They came up with legal 
restrictions, which make our criminal justice system look... They made it impossible 
for the state... to punish someone by killing them. 

BARTLET
We make it very hard to kill anybody in this country, Toby.

TOBY
It should be impossible.

BARTLET
But it’s not.

TOBY
But it should be.

They just stare at each other until Leo comes in.

BARTLET
Hey.

LEO
Hey. What’s going on?

BARTLET
Toby went to Shul.

Leo looks back and forth between Bartlet and Toby.

TOBY
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

LEO
[sits in front of Bartlet] Japan opened huge.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Up two cents against the Yen.

BARTLET
I commute this guy, for no particular reason other than I don’t like the death penalty...

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
And the next President sees it in a different way. I’ve laid track to all kinds of... 
The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.

LEO
Well, if that’s the only thing that’s stopping you... 

BARTLET
We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval 
Office. It’s cruel and unusual. 

LEO
If that’s the only thing stopping you, then I’ll say this for the first time in your 
Presidency... Let that be the next guy’s problem.

There’s a knock at the door, then Nancy sticks her head in.

NANCY
Sir. Sam Seaborn?

BARTLET
Okay. Give me a minute please, Nancy. [looks at Leo and shakes his head]

LEO
I’ll take care of it.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam and Charlie are just outside the Oval Office.

SAM
The U.S. is one of five countries on earth that puts to death people who’re under 
the age of 18 when they committed a crime.

CHARLIE
Nigeria.

SAM
Pakistan.

CHARLIE
Saudi Arabia and Iran?

SAM
Yeah. So, that’s a list we definitely want to be on. 

LEO
[comes out of the Oval Office] Sam.

SAM
Leo, I put my notes together. I...

LEO
Walk with me.

SAM
Actually, I was hoping to see the President.

LEO
You’re not going to see the President, Sam.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
He’s done.

SAM
We have six hours...

LEO
He’s done.

They head off walking into the HALLWAY.

SAM
Leo, it’s not an impossible sell.

LEO
I’ve lived longer than you, Sam...

SAM
Leo.

LEO
[shouts] He’s done, and I gotta tell you, Sam, this was bungled. We were totally 
unprepared for this.

SAM
What the hell are you...?

LEO
We were caught in the headlights... This thing was supposed to go back to the sixth 
circuit. And I don’t know how it happened...

SAM
[shouts] What are you talking about, prepared? The court sat. What would you have 
done differently? [They stop walking.]

LEO
I’d have...

SAM
What would you have done different? You’d have kept the President out of the country 
another two days?

LEO
[quietly] Yes.

SAM
Leo, there are times when we are absolutely nowhere. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
Josh is sitting at the bar in a hotel. Joey and Kenny come in to meet him.

JOSH
Hello. [to Kenny] Hi.

KENNY
Hi.

JOSH
[to Joey] Thank you for meeting me.

JOEY [KENNY]
Our flight’s in one hour.

JOSH
Aren’t you impressed that I was able to track you down?

JOEY [KENNY]
Was it hard?

JOSH
It was very hard. I had to have my assistant call your office in California. 

Joey looks disgusted.

JOSH
It’s funny, when I say it out loud like that, it doesn’t sound that impressive.

JOEY [KENNY]
Do you make me meet you here so you could do more jokes?

JOSH
[gets serious] No, I came at the request of the President. He wanted you to know 
that he felt that he was rude to you in the Oval Office yesterday. He apologizes 
if he was abrupt about your problem and while the tightening of your funding was 
political strategy on our part, he honestly feels that your candidate is a schmuck 
who gives liberalism a bad name.

Joey thinks about this, and then smiles.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yeah, I think so too.

JOSH
[with a big grin] I know you do. Why are you working for him?

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m a professional political operative. I need to work. I mean, it’s not exactly 
like there’s a seller’s market for deaf campaign managers.

JOSH
I’d imagine. He also wanted me to tell you that he meant what he said. Come up with 
a live one and we’ll get interested in a hurry. [puts money on the bar for his drink]

JOEY [KENNY]
Did he have any suggestions?

JOSH
As a matter of fact, he did.

JOEY
Who?

JOSH
[whispers] You. 

Joey looks shocked. 

JOSH
You guys have a nice flight back. 

Joey looks absolutely stunned as she watches him go.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
SUNDAY, 11:57 P.M.
Bartlet is standing at the window in the Oval Office. He is looking out at the 
falling snow and holding a rosary. Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
Mr. President? [beat] Excuse me, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Father Cavanaugh.

BARTLET
Thank you. 

He walks to the door. FATHER THOMAS CAVANAUGH enters.

BARTLET
Tom.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Mr. President. [They hug.]

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie. 

Charlie leaves.

BARTLET
Thanks for coming all this way down.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
It was no trouble. I’m just sorry I couldn’t get here until now.

BARTLET
Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Oh. I can see the Oval Office.

BARTLET
This is it. 

They walk farther into the room. 

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Show me around the room.

BARTLET
You’re looking at the room.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Well, uh, where’s the red phone?

BARTLET
We don’t use the red phone anymore.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Well, how do you talk to the Kremlin?
 
BARTLET
I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
No. No thanks. [pause] I don’t know how to address you. Would you prefer Jed or 
Mr. President?

BARTLET
To be honest, I prefer Mr. President.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
That’s fine.

BARTLET
You understand why, right?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Do I need to know why?

BARTLET
It’s not ego.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
I didn’t think it was.

BARTLET
There are certain decisions I have to make while I’m in this room. Do I send troops 
into harm’s way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Sure.

BARTLET
It’s helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Then Mr. President it is.

BARTLET
I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the 
public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of 
racism.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
So your staff spent the weekend looking for a way out.

BARTLET
Yeah.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Like the kid in right field who doesn’t want the ball to get hit to him.

They sit down.

BARTLET
I’m the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital 
punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Did you call the Pope?

BARTLET
Yeah.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
And how do you do that?

BARTLET
[upset] Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, “Somebody get me the Pope.”

FATHER CAVANAUGH
No, I’m sorry, Mr. President, but I was thinking... You’re just this kid from my parish 
and now you’re calling the Pope.

BARTLET
Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
“‘Vengeance is mine,’ sayeth the Lord.” You know what that means? God is the only one 
who gets to kill people.

BARTLET
I know.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
That was your way out.

BARTLET
I know.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Did you pray?

BARTLET
I did, Tom. I know it’s hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
And none came?

BARTLET
[shakes his head] It never has. And I’m a little pissed off about that. 

He looks at his watch, which says it’s a few seconds before midnight. It hits him hard.

BARTLET
[dead serious] I’m not kidding.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
You know, you remind me of the man that lived by the river. He heard a radio report 
that the river was going to rush up and flood the town. And that all the residents 
should evacuate their homes. But the man said, “I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. 
God will save me.” The waters rose up. A guy in a row boat came along and he shouted, 
“Hey, hey you! You in there. The town is flooding. Let me take you to safety.” But the 
man shouted back, “I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.” A helicopter 
was hovering overhead. And a guy with a megaphone shouted, “Hey you, you down there. 
The town is flooding. Let me drop this ladder and I’ll take you to safety.” But the 
man shouted back that he was religious, that he prayed, that God loved him and that 
God will take him to safety. Well... the man drowned. And standing at the gates of 
St. Peter, he demanded an audience with God. “Lord,” he said, “I’m a religious man, 
I pray. I thought you loved me. Why did this happen?” God said, “I sent you a radio 
report, a helicopter, and a guy in a rowboat. What the hell are you doing here?”

He pauses. Bartlet looks very upset.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
He sent you a priest, a rabbi, and a Quaker, Mr. President. Not to mention his son, 
Jesus Christ. What do you want from him?

There is a knock on the door.

C.J.
Excuse me.

C.J. comes in, hands Bartlet a note, and leaves. Bartlet reads the note, and then 
crumples it up as he goes to lean on the desk. He looks exceedingly troubled.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Jed. Would you like me to hear your confession?

BARTLET
Yes, please.

Father Cavanaugh pulls out his stole and puts it on. The President kneels beside him, 
over the Presidential seal. He performs the sign of the cross.

BARTLET
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned...

Transcript By:	Cindy Dechief


West Wing S01E15
Sam (Rob Lowe) and Toby (Richard Schiff) are dispatched to Connecticut for some damage control and to secure the secret release of President Bartlet's (Martin Sheen) choice, Roberto Mendoza (Edward James Olmos) for the Supreme Court, who has been jailed for alleged drunk driving and resisting arrest. Meanwhile, Josh (Bradley Whitford) is a guest lecturer at a college class to talk about working for the President and he recounts the previous week's flare-ups, which include: his feeble attempt to fill in as the White House spokesman at a press conference where he promises that the President has "a secret plan to fight inflation," and the media glare that engulfs the African-American HUD secretary, Debbie O'Leary (CCH Pounder) who publicly labeled a prominent Republican as a racist.

TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
DAVID NESSLER, a lecturer, is standing on the stage. Students are taking their seats.

NESSLER
Good evening. Welcome to the third installment of this year’s Marjorie Dupont lecture 
series. I see by the size of the turnout that you’re excited to meet tonight’s guest. 
So let me spend some time...

Backstage, Josh is talking on the phone with Sam.

JOSH
What’re you talking about?

SAM
He was arrested.

JOSH
For what?

Sam is standing outside on a street, talking on the phone.

SAM
Drunk driving, resisting arrest, and I think disorderly conduct.

JOSH
You think?

SAM
This thing’s about 30 minutes old, Josh. I don’t know exactly what happened.

JOSH
What do we know?

SAM
Mendoza doesn’t drink.

JOSH
He’s arrested for drunk driving.

SAM
Roberto Mendoza doesn’t drink, Josh.

JOSH
How much does the press know?

SAM
They don’t know anything.

JOSH
The cops haven’t leaked it?

SAM
I swear to God, I don’t think the cops know.

JOSH
They don’t know that they’ve arrested Roberto Mendoza?

SAM
They don’t know it’s that Roberto Mendoza.

JOSH
I’ve got this thing now.

A cab pulls up and Sam gets in.

SAM
I got a cab. [to driver] The White House. [to Josh] I’ll let you know what’s going on.

JOSH
Stay ahead of the pace, Sam, and have Toby page me. We don’t even know if this guy’s 
called a lawyer. Is he sitting in a jail cell right now? [beat] You’re not there 
anymore, are you? I’m talking to no one at all right now. [closes phone]

Josh stands wait backstage. We can hear the lecturer telling the audience about him.

NESSLER
...Beltway, where he worked as floor manager to the House Minority whip and chief of 
staff for Congressman Earl Brennan. After serving as senior political director for Jed 
Bartlet’s Presidential campaign, he was appointed Deputy White House Chief of Staff. 
Please welcome Joshua Lyman.

The audience starts to applaud as Josh comes on stage. He shakes hands with the lecturer.

JOSH
Thank you. Thank you very much.

NESSLER
Good to see you.

JOSH
Thanks David. Good to see you.

NESSLER
Have a seat. [They both sit.] Just slip that mike on there.

JOSH
[puts on mic] Here.

NESSLER
Josh, you’re here to tell us what it’s like to work for the President.

JOSH
I’ll do my best.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam walks inside the office, where C.J. is waiting.
 
C.J.
What happened?

SAM
It’s not as bad as you think, C.J.

C.J.
Was the President’s nominee for the Supreme Court just arrested for drunk driving?

SAM
Yes.

C.J.
Then it’s pretty bad, isn’t it?

SAM
Sure.

C.J.
I thought he doesn’t drink.

SAM
He doesn’t drink.

C.J.
He was tonight.

SAM
C.J., we’ve vetted the man. I’m not saying he’s not a heavy drinker, I’m saying he 
doesn’t drink.

C.J.
Then what was he pulled over for?

SAM
Driving while being...Hispanic.

C.J.
Does Toby know?

TOBY
[enters] I stepped off the edge of the world.

SAM
[to C.J.] Yes.

TOBY
Where’d this happen?

SAM
Wesley, Connecticut.

C.J.
Why’d he refuse the Breathalyzer?

TOBY
‘Cause he’s a crazy man who’s out to ruin my life. 

SAM
Toby?

TOBY
That’s what he’s out to do. Has anyone posted bail? 

SAM
No.

TOBY
Why not?

SAM
They can’t find a judge.

TOBY
Why not?

C.J.
It’s not Cook County, Toby. It’s Friday night in Wesley, Connecticut.

TOBY
Believe me when I tell you this, C.J. I will figure out a way to blame this on you.

C.J.
I have no doubt about that.

LEO walks in.

LEO
Have someone find his lawyer and talk to him. Sam, there’s an Air Force Lear jet with 
its motor running. Fly to Westchester County airport, rent a car, drive to Wesley, and 
get the next associate Justice of the Supreme Court out of jail. C.J., Sam sees one 
reporter when he gets off that plane, I’m gonna blame you.

C.J.
Toby’s got you covered there.

Sam and C.J. start to leave.

TOBY
I’m going with Sam.

LEO
Toby.

TOBY
The judge and I are gonna have an abrupt conversation. 

LEO
I want my phone to ring once every 15 minutes. I want to know what’s going on!

Toby, Sam and C.J. leave the office.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
The lecture series continues.

NESSLER
Josh, why don’t you start by telling us about a typical day at the White House?

JOSH
Well, the first thing I’ll tell you is, there’s no such thing. [audience laughs]

JOSH [cont.]
There’s a schedule and there’s a structure to be sure, and to a certain extent it starts 
out as a 9-to-5 job, but you can pretty much count on it being blown to hell by 9:30. 
[audience laughs]

NESSLER
Give us an example.

JOSH
I-I’ll give you an example from this week. In fact, the story I’m about to tell you 
all happened within the last 36 hours. Anyone who’s been reading the papers in the 
last few days has probably been following along with what we call the news cycle 
that wouldn’t end. Depending on how you look at it, it started either with a cabinet 
secretary losing her temper, a committee chairman baiting her during a hearing, the 
President answering a question he shouldn’t have, a dentist appointment, or me being 
stupid. [audience laughs] For the record, I’d like to say that I don’t think it was 
as much my fault as other people do. [audience laughs] One thing’s for sure, it 
started out as a day that was supposed to trumpet the President’s vision for 
educational reform.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - PREVIOUS MORNING
Sam, Toby, and C.J. are in the empty press briefing room, going over the next briefing.

SAM
Give me the bullet points.

C.J.
I understand this stuff.

SAM
Excellent.

C.J.
I really do.

SAM
I have complete confidence in you.

C.J.
Thank you.

TOBY
Give him the bullet points.

C.J.
I feel bathed in your confidence as well, Toby.

TOBY
C.J.?

C.J.
Forgive student loans to people who become teachers --

TOBY
And?

C.J.
-- and spend at least three years teaching in a rural or inner-city school. Give cash 
bonuses to people who leave other careers to become teachers and provide federal money 
for grants to individual school districts to use older, more experienced teachers to 
train younger, less experienced teachers.

TOBY
Should note that half of all new teachers quit in the first three years.

C.J.
It’s right here on my index card, Toby. [shows him index card]

TOBY
Very good, then.

JOSH
[comes in the door] Toby.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Got a minute?

TOBY
Yeah.

Josh and Toby head out one door, as C.J. and Sam get ready to leave by the other.

C.J.
Thank you both.

SAM
Hey, you know what? 

C.J.
What?

SAM
What time is your briefing?

C.J.
Eleven o’clock.

SAM
We should push it to one o’clock.

Sam and C.J. leave the briefing room into the HALLWAY. Carol follows them behind.

C.J.
I thought about that.

SAM
Do it after the bill signing. Let this be the story. Let’s control the news cycle.

C.J.
Carol, let’s move the briefing to one.

CAROL
You can’t.

C.J.
Why not?

CAROL
You have the thing.

C.J.
Yes, and this is a perfect excuse to postpone the thing.

CAROL
You really don’t wanna do that.

SAM
You have a thing?

C.J.
I have a dentist appointment at noon.

SAM
What’s wrong?

C.J.
Nothing’s wrong.

SAM
C.J.?

C.J.
I’m experiencing some pain.

SAM
For how long?

C.J.
About a month now, but it’ll go away by itself.

SAM
When?

C.J.
When I die, Sam. [to Carol] Carol, cancel the appointment. [walks into her office]

SAM
Carol, set the briefing for two o’clock. Keep the appointment.

C.J.
Sam!

They enter C.J.'S OFFICE.

SAM
Your teeth are the best friends you got, C.J.

C.J.
They are?

SAM
You take care of them, they’ll take care of you.

C.J.
When’d you start talking like this?

SAM
I’m nuts for dental hygiene.

C.J.
Go away. Now.

SAM
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Josh and Toby head for the Communications Office. Josh has just told Toby some news.

TOBY
She called him a racist?

JOSH
She didn’t use that word.

TOBY
What word did she use?

JOSH
Well, yes, she used that word.

Toby and Josh walk in the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. 

TOBY
Bonnie. Ginger.

GINGER
Yes?

TOBY
I want anything that might be on the wire already about the HUD Secretary calling Jack 
Wooden a racist.

BONNIE
You want it now?

TOBY
No, Bonnie, I want it at whatever leisurely pace you two feel...

BONNIE
I’m just asking.

TOBY
I want it now. [to Josh] On C-SPAN, she called him a racist?

JOSH
Nah, not just Wooden. She was pretty careful to include all Republicans. [chuckles]

TOBY
Why are you good humored about this?

JOSH
She was baited.

TOBY
Don’t care.

JOSH
She was baited and she was right.

TOBY
Good for her.

MANDY
[walks in, carrying a sheet of paper] Excuse me, Josh. Did you know that Deborah O’Leary 
called...?

TOBY
Is that a wire story?

JOSH
What’s it say?

MANDY
[reads from paper] “Wooden’s lengthy recitation of problems confronting public housing 
drew an angry response from Secretary O’Leary.” Here’s what she said: “‘Public housing 
has serious problems, Mr. Chairman, I don’t deny that. But if you and your colleagues 
in the Republican party...’”

TOBY
[groans] No!

MANDY
[continues reading] “‘...were as invested in solving the problems associated with poverty 
as you are in scoring political points on the backs of poor people and minorities, you 
might just see the value.’ ‘Are you calling me a racist?’ Wooden shot back.” 

TOBY
“Of course not,” she answered wisely?

MANDY
[reading] “‘If the shoe fits,’ responded the secretary.”

TOBY
Well, wasn’t that clever of her? [goes in his office]

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH
Donald Morales, who is the spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
and who was wishing he hadn’t gotten out of bed that morning, confirms what happened. 
Now there’s the matter of telling the President.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - PREVIOUS MORNING
Bartlet is just reading the story. Toby, Josh, Sam and Leo are with him.

BARTLET
“If the shoe fits!”

TOBY
Gets a little bit worse, actually.

BARTLET
[reading] “When reporters confronted Secretary O’Leary in a hallway outside the hearing 
room, she defended...” Oh come on!

LEO
Don’t worry about it.

BARTLET
Leo!

LEO
I’ll take care of it. [to staff] She on her way here?

JOSH
She’ll be here in half an hour.

CHARLIE
[knocks and comes in] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah. [to staff] Let’s go. [They all head out of the Oval Office.]
“If the shoe fits.” Is that the best she could do? 

LEO
Of her many transgressions, Mr. President, let’s not worry about she resorted to cliché.

They all walk in THE MURAL ROOM, which is full of reporters.

HERALD
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT
Josh continues to talk.

JOSH
The President spoke briefly. [pause] The President has never spoken briefly in his life! 
[audience laughs] But, he spoke. He signed the bill. He gave away the pens. Then he took 
a few questions from the press. Now, before I go on, it should be pointed out that 
according to every poll conducted in the universe, the issue that concerns Americans 
more than any other is education. Now, The President has just signed off on $700,000,000 
in new money for education and announced a plan of aggressive education initiative. 
What do you suppose the first question from the press was?

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - PREVIOUS MORNING

DANNY
Mr. President, do you agree with Secretary O’Leary that Congressman Wooden is a racist, 
and if not, do you plan on asking for her resignation?

The President is sitting at a desk in the Mural Room, with Toby, Sam, Josh and Leo 
standing beside him. Danny is part of the group of reporters surrounding them. 
Cameras flash everywhere.

BARTLET
Let me say that I have great confidence in Deborah O’Leary. She’s done a terrific job 
at HUD, helping thousands of people make the very difficult transition from joblessness 
and homelessness to more fulfilling and productive lives.

Other reporters start to ask questions, but Danny cuts them off.

DANNY
I’m sorry, Mr. President. You didn’t answer the question.

BARTLET
I was hoping you weren’t going to notice that, Danny.

DANNY
I did, sir.

BARTLET
Then I will tell you that I agree the Republican Party does not have a comprehensive 
program for combating poverty in this country. That being said, there are countless 
Republicans who are working very hard to change their party’s legacy on some of these 
issues. And I hope to be working with them to do just that.

Reporters start asking questions again, but Danny takes over once again.

DANNY 
I’m sure that was an answer to some question, Mr. President. It just wasn’t the answer 
to mine.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH
If only we’d stopped it right there. If only we’d said, uh, “Sorry, The President 
can’t take any questions right now,” or, uh, “We’ll cover this in a briefing,” or, 
“The building is on fire!” [audience laughs] But for some reason, it took us all a 
moment to realize that there was no Press Secretary in the room.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - PREVIOUS MORNING
Bartlet continues to answer Danny’s question.

BARTLET
Frankly, I think she went too far in assigning motive to Congressman Wooden and the 
Republican Party.

REPORTER 1
Will you be speaking to her?

BARTLET
She’ll be meeting with Leo McGarry.

REPORTER 2
Will he ask her to apologize?

BARTLET
An apology’d be appropriate.

Leo and Josh have just realized what Bartlet just said. 

LEO
Oh, get him off.

JOSH
[fakes cough] Sam!

SAM
[steps forward and addresses the room] Folks, all this is gonna be covered in the two 
o’clock briefing. The President’s late for lunch with the U.N. ambassador. I’m sorry.

BARTLET 
[to reporters] Thank you everyone. [gets up and they head back towards the Oval Office]
That went pretty well.

LEO
We’ll fix it.

TOBY 
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

TOBY
The U.N. ambassador is in Portugal.

SAM
Okay. My bad.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH
Eight words. “The President’s not taking any questions right now.” If we’d just stepped 
in 30 seconds sooner. 

Josh's cellphone rings.

JOSH [cont.]
That’s me. I’m sorry. I, uh-there’s a thing. I have... I have to answer this now. This’ll 
just, uh, take a second. This is weird, I know, but, uh, anyway... 

Josh takes off his mike, goes BACKSTAGE, and answers his phone.

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY 
Yeah, it’s me.

JOSH
Are you there yet?

CUT TO: EXT. CONNECTICUT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Sam is driving a car, and Toby is in the passenger seat.

TOBY
We’re lost.

JOSH 
You’re lost?

SAM
We’re not lost.

TOBY
You’re from Connecticut. What exit do we want for Wesley?

JOSH 
What?

TOBY
We missed the exit.

SAM
We didn’t miss the exit.

JOSH
Toby, I’m kind of in the middle of something here.

TOBY
Just tell me.

JOSH 
You bet buddy.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Call me when you know something. [closes his phone and gets back to his seat] 
Sorry about that.

NESSLER
Can you tell us what that was about?

JOSH
The, uh, trade deficit. Where was I?

NESSLER
If you’d only gotten there 30 seconds sooner.

JOSH
The day would’ve gone a lot differently. The President had said that Secretary O’Leary 
should apologize. The press wanted to know if she would be fired if she didn’t and we 
didn’t have an answer. She was coming up to the White House for a showdown. This was 
what the day was about now. And the day was about to get worse...because I was about 
to step to the plate. 

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. CONNECTICUT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Toby and Sam are still in the car.

TOBY
We’re going the wrong way.

SAM
No, we’re not.

TOBY
We’re supposed to be going east.

SAM
We’re going east.

TOBY
How do you know we’re going east?

SAM
The sun rises in the east.

TOBY
It’s dark outside!

SAM
Also, that bright star in the northern sky is Polaris. 

TOBY
So what?

SAM
I’m using celestial navigation.

TOBY
Hey, Galileo, get off at the next exit and turn the car around.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
Josh continues to tell his story.

JOSH
Secretary O’Leary was told that Leo McGarry wanted to see her as soon as possible. 
There was no question that she was going to be angry about the President publicly 
asking her to apologize, but at the moment, that was Leo’s problem.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
Leo is talking to the Housing and Urban Development secretary, DEBORAH O’LEARY. 

O’LEARY
I can’t believe he did that, Leo.

LEO
Debbie.

O’LEARY
How could he?

LEO
You’re pissed at us?

O’LEARY
How could he publicly demand that I apologize without hearing my side of the story first?

LEO 
We blew the press today, we’ll come to that. But Debbie, I’ve got videotape of your side 
of the story.

O’LEARY
The man’s a racist.

LEO
Maybe so...

O’LEARY
Maybe!

LEO
Debbie.

O’LEARY
He’s using his government authority to spit at poor people and minorities, which in his 
mind are the same thing.

LEO
Look...

O’LEARY
He’s doing it because he can. He’s doing it because he can score points with his 
narrow-minded constituents. 

LEO
His narrow-minded constituents are also our narrow-minded constituents.

O’LEARY
Oh, for crying out loud, Leo. [yells] When are you guys gonna stop running for President?

LEO
When angels dance on pinheads, Debbie. We need their votes on any number of issues, 
including, by the way, the budget for the department of Housing and Urban Development.

O’LEARY
Attacking HUD is code for attacking blacks.

LEO
[dryly] Thanks. Having been born yesterday on a turnip truck...

O’LEARY
Do you not think it is my role as the highest-ranking African-American woman in government 
to point out that...?

LEO
I think, Debbie, your role first and foremost is to serve the President--a task today at 
which you failed spectacularly. 

O’LEARY
Leo...

LEO
You’re gonna apologize.

O’LEARY
[thinks for a moment] I’m sorry. 

LEO
Not to me, Debbie.

O’LEARY
Look, I called it like I saw it.

LEO
Well, now you’re gonna apologize for it.

O’LEARY
I can’t.

LEO
You can.

O’LEARY
I won’t.

LEO
[forcefully] You will.

O’LEARY
Is that an order?

LEO
You’re doing great work, Deb. The President’s nuts about you, always has been. He’ll cry 
for three minutes after he fires your ass and then he’ll say “What’s next?”

O’LEARY
Leo, if I’ve gotta go and ask Wooden for forgiveness, he’s gonna lord it over me from now 
until the end of time.

LEO
It’s the cost of doing business.

O’LEARY
[gives in] Done.

LEO
Deb, he’s been trying to provoke you for months. When you give in to him, you surrender 
the high ground.

O’LEARY
How did it happen?

LEO
You forgot what your grandfather taught you.

O’LEARY
What was that?

LEO
“Never argue with a drunk or a fool.”

O’LEARY
Is the President very angry with me? 

LEO
Mostly he’s upset that you couldn’t come up with anything better than “if the shoe fits.” 
[both chuckle] Good luck. 

O’LEARY
Thank you. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH
So that should’ve been it, right? C.J. Cregg does the two o’clock briefing, tells them 
Secretary O’Leary has an apology for Congressman Wooden. All questions on the matter will 
be handled by her spokesperson, Donald Morales, and redirects their attention to the 700 
million bucks of yours that we just spent on teachers. 
[pause] Who here has had emergency root canal? 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
C.J. knocks at the door. She has a swollen cheek and is speaking out of the side of 
her mouth.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
[muffled] Josh.

JOSH
What the hell happened?

C.J.
I had woot canaw.

JOSH
What happened to your cheeks?

C.J.
I had woot canaw.

JOSH
Why are you talking like that?

C.J. 
[louder] I had woot canaw!

JOSH
Yeah, I heard you the first time, I was just amusing myself.

C.J.
I can suggest some othew things you can do wiff yourseff.

JOSH
Are you in pain?

C.J.
[shouts] I had woot canaw! [grabs her jaw with a pained expression]

JOSH
You’re gonna need to stop saying that, ‘cause you just look and sound so ridiculous.
[walks out into the bullpen with C.J. following him]

C.J. 
I have to cancew the bwiefing.

JOSH
You can’t cancel the briefing.

C.J. 
Wook at me.

JOSH
You’ll be great.

C.J.
I can’t do the bwiefing.

JOSH
Why not?

C.J. 
I can’t even say “bwiefing.”

JOSH
You can’t cancel the briefing, C.J. You got to wrap up O’Leary, you got to move them back 
to the bill signing.

C.J.
Yoshua!

JOSH 
Sorry, did... did you just say my name?

C.J. 
You weally think I can do it?

JOSH
Don’t be insane, C.J. You’re not going to a press briefing looking like Bullwinkle.

C.J. 
Oh, so once again you’we just hawing a wittle fun! 

JOSH 
Yeah.

C.J. 
Ha ha ha ha ha. 

They head back into JOSH’s OFFICE.

JOSH
When can you take the cotton out?

C.J. 
Two houws. I’w have Cawow cancew the bwiefing.

JOSH
No, we’re still doing it.

C.J. 
Who?

JOSH
Me.

C.J. 
No way!

JOSH
C.J.?

C.J. 
You get howstiwe.

JOSH 
I get... hot stuff?

C.J. 
Howstiwe. Howstiwe. You get howstiwe!

JOSH
I don’t get hostile! I don’t get randomly hostile, I get hostile when hostility’s 
called for.

C.J. 
Wet Sam do it.

JOSH 
Sam went to Foggy Bottom.

C.J.
What’s he doing in Fwoggy Bowtew?

JOSH
[laughs] I just wanted to see if I could make you say “Foggy Bottom.” Sam’s working with 
the speechwriters.

C.J.
Toby?

JOSH 
Toby’s with Leo and the President.

C.J.
Josh...

JOSH
[pulls on suit jacket and heads out] Hey there cats and kittens. This is Josh Lyman 
coming at you with your two o’clock briefing!

C.J. 
Josh, pwease be vewy cawefuw. Twy vewy, vewy hawd not to destwoy us.

JOSH 
You shouldn’t say that C.J., you’ve got a great body... Here we go. Woo!

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON 
Carol is speaking into the P.A. system. Josh comes in and is stopped by Danny.

CAROL
Please take your seats, we’ll start the briefing. Please take your seats.

DANNY
Josh.

JOSH
Hey, Danny.

DANNY 
You’re not gonna do this.

JOSH
Do the briefing?

DANNY 
You’re not gonna do this.

JOSH 
I talk to reporters all the time.

DANNY
You really don’t want to do this.

JOSH 
Let me tell you something, mi compadre. You guys have been coddled. I’m not your 
girlfriend, I’m not your camp counselor, and I’m not you sixth grade teacher you 
had a crush on. I’m a graduate of Harvard and Yale and I believe that my powers of 
debate can rise to meet the Socratic wonder that is the White House Press Corps. 
[heads to the podium]

DANNY 
Okey-dokey.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
C.J. is watching the briefing on the T.V.

JOSH [on T.V.] 
Good afternoon, everybody. Would you take your seats. Uh, C.J. has a dental emergency, 
so I’ll handle the briefing today.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH 
I’d like to say a couple things in my own defense. First of all, everything was fine. 
I dispensed of the Deborah O’Leary matter with ease and poise. I opened the room up to 
questions while imposing a discipline I felt had been lacking in C.J.’s briefings.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
Josh is at the podium doing the briefing.

JOSH 
I’m gonna take one question a piece.

MIKE 
Josh!

JOSH 
Mike.

MIKE
When was the last time the President has a cigarette? 

JOSH 
Mike, you sure you want your one question to be that stupid?

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is still watching the briefing. A reporter, Katie, remarks on Josh’s response.

KATIE [on T.V.]
It’s not a stupid question, Josh.

C.J. 
Oh my God.

KATIE [on T.V.]
If the President’s going to continue to be so adamantly anti-tobacco, why is it 
unreasonable to ask if he’s a smoker?

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
The President quit smoking years ago.

KATIE
He bummed a cigarette from me on Air Force One two days ago.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Oh my God.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Well, then, uh... Jonathan.

JONATHAN
So, you’re not gonna answer Katie’s question? 

JOSH
I’ll look into it. Danny?

DANNY
Josh, your comments were that the continuing drop in unemployment will create increased 
pressure on wages. In effect, driving them up. Is the President worried that this could 
lead to a resurgence of inflation?

JOSH 
Let me emphasize the President is pleased that unemployment has dropped another point five 
percent as a result...

DANNY 
I’m sure we all join the President in his joy, but I’m wondering if the President has a 
plan to fight the resulting inflation.

JOSH 
The President will do everything in his power to maintain the robust economy that has 
created millions of new jobs, improved productivity and kept a lid on inflation.

KATIE
But he has no plan to address inflation specifically?

JOSH 
Twenty-four PhD’s and a Counsel of Economy Advisors, Katie. They have a plan to fight 
inflation.

DANNY 
Is the reason you won’t tell us about it that it’s a secret?

JOSH 
[sarcastic] Yeah, Danny. We have a secret inflation plan.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J. 
[now cringing] Oh my God!

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH
I guess that’s pretty much when the wheels came off the wagon.

NESSLER
Josh, right here is a good time to take our break. Everybody, let’s stretch our legs for 
five minutes. Sign-up sheets for 202 are in the lobby. If you smoke, apparently you can 
bum a cigarette on Air Force One. Let’s have a hand for our guest Joshua Lyman. 

The audience applauds.

CUT TO: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
Josh comes out of the lecture hall into the lobby, where students are standing around. 
He dials his cell phone.

STUDENT
You’re great.

JOSH
Thanks. 

CUT TO: EXT. CONNECTICUT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Toby and Sam are still in the car. Toby’s phone rings. He answers it.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
What’s going on?

TOBY
Sam feels we’re zeroing in on it.

JOSH
You haven’t found it yet?

TOBY
We’ve been navigating by the North Star, which turned out to be the Delta shuttle from 
LaGuardia. It’s a miracle we’re not in Nantucket right now. [glares at Sam]

JOSH
Toby, how hard can it be to find the Wesley police station?

TOBY
I don’t know, Josh, but while we’re looking, can you tell me a little more about the 
President’s secret plan to fight inflation?

JOSH
How long until you let up on me on that?

TOBY
Oh, it’s gonna take a little while I would think.

JOSH
Call me when you know something. [hangs up]

SAM
There’s a store open up there. I’m gonna pull over and ask ‘em if they know where the 
Wesley police station is.

TOBY
Or you could just pull in there, [points] at the Wesley police station and ask them.

SAM
Hey!

TOBY 
Yeah.

SAM
Look!

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
We found it!

TOBY
Let’s get this done and get outta here.

They pull into the parking lot at the police station. They get out of the car.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. WESLEY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Sam goes up to the desk, where OFFICER PETER is reading the newspaper. Toby hangs back 
and paces.

SAM
Good evening.

OFFICER PETER
Evening.

SAM
[shows I.D.] My name is Sam Seaborn. I work for the President of the United States. 
Is your watch commander around? 

OFFICER PETER
Is this a joke?

SAM
No.

OFFICER PETER
You walk in here. You tell me you work for the President.

SAM
[looks at officer’s name tag] Officer Peter, we’re in a certain amount of trouble tonight 
and the only thing I’ve got going for me is that you’re in more trouble than we are. 
My name is Sam Seaborn, I work for the President and the sooner you reach the conclusion 
that I’m telling you the truth the better off we’re all gonna be. Why don’t you go get 
your watch commander?

Officer Peter goes out of the room. Sam turns to Toby.

SAM
Let me tell you something. If we’d stayed on the Merritt parkway instead of getting 
of at exit 29 and going east to Greenwich, I don’t think we’d wound up in Bridgeport 
so many times.

TOBY
Shut up.

Officer Peter comes back with SERGEANT McNAMARA.

SERGEANT McNAMARA
I’m Sergeant McNamara. Can I help you folks?

SAM
Sergeant, I’m Sam Seaborn. I’m the Deputy White House Communications Director. That’s my 
boss, Toby Ziegler. [gestures to Toby]

SERGEANT McNAMARA
I’m not really in the mood for a joke right now.

SAM
I know how you feel. You have Roberto Mendoza locked up back there.

SERGEANT McNAMARA
Sir, please state your business here, or I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.

SAM
My business is to tell you to unlock the cell and give me Mendoza.

Officer Peter looks down at the newspaper in the table and tried to interrupt.

OFFICER PETER
Sergeant?

SERGEANT McNAMARA
You come in here at ten o’clock at night, and you tell me you’re with the White House, 
and I’m just supposed to...

OFFICER PETER
Sergeant!

Officer Peter shows the sergeant the newspaper. On the front page is a picture of 
President Bartlet with Toby. The caption reads “President Bartlet Drafts Letter to 
Senate Leaders.” They look up at Toby, who just smiles.

SAM
Sergeant, you’ve arrested a federal judge who’s the President’s nominee for the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 

The police phone rings.
 
SAM [cont.]
You should get that. That’s gonna be the Governor of Connecticut. 

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
The lecture break is over, and Josh is talking again.

JOSH
Danny Concannon had thrown me a knuckle ball in the dirt, which I’d taken a big swing at 
and - just like that - the President had a secret plan to fight inflation.

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
Josh is still behind the podium, answering questions.

REPORTER 1 
Josh, when will the President unveil his secret plan?

JOSH 
There is no secret plan!

REPORTER 2 
You said...

JOSH 
[laughs] I was talking to Danny. I was kidding! 

REPORTER 3 
These are people’s jobs we’re talking about, Josh. You wanna give us a straight answer?

JOSH 
[looks flustered] I honestly can’t remember the question.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
C.J. groans and takes some painkillers.

REPORTER 3 [on T.V.]
Given the reduction in unemployment, does the President have a plan to fight the ensuing 
inflation? 

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

REPORTER 4
And if so, why is he keeping it a secret?

Josh looks befuddled as Danny smiles triumphantly. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
Josh leaves the Briefing Room. Carol is standing at the door and gives him a dirty look, 
while Donna rushes up to him. They head for his office.

DONNA 
Oh my God, Josh. I mean, oh my God!

JOSH
I can fix this.

DONNA 
How?

JOSH 
I can fix this.

DONNA 
I don’t think you can.

JOSH
[yells] This’d be a great time to feel a little support from you, Donna!

DONNA 
You have my support, Josh.

JOSH
Do I?

DONNA 
Yes.

JOSH
Okay, good, that’s a start. Tell me what you think I should do right now.

DONNA 
Go into your office and come up with a secret plan to fight inflation.

JOSH 
[yells] That’s support?!

They come around the corner to see C.J. standing in the door of JOSH’S OFFICE.

C.J. 
[yells] Joshua!

JOSH 
Yeah, that’s the face I wanted to see right now.

C.J.
What the heww happened in thewe?

JOSH 
C.J....

C.J. 
You compwetewy impwoded!

JOSH 
What’d I do?

DONNA 
[translates] You completely imploded.

JOSH 
I wouldn’t say completely.

C.J. 
You wewe vague, you wewe howstiwe, you wewe bewwigewant!

Josh looks confused.

DONNA 
[translates] Belligerent.

C.J. 
You know what it’s gonna take fow me to fix this? 

JOSH 
I’m gonna fix this.

C.J. 
No, you’we not. You awe not evew awwowed in my pwess woom again!

JOSH 
Donna, call up Toby’s office and see if he was watching.

As Donna leaves, they hear Toby yelling from the hall.

TOBY 
[yells] Where the hell is he?

JOSH 
Never mind. [to C.J.] Support me on this.

C.J. 
No.

JOSH 
Thanks. [Toby walks in.] Toby...

TOBY
Have you fallen on your head?

JOSH 
Listen...

TOBY 
Have you fallen down and hit your head on something hard?

JOSH 
I feel really bad about this.

TOBY
You do?

JOSH 
Yes.

TOBY 
[sarcastic] Oh, well then I guess that’s all that really matters.

JOSH 
Hey!

TOBY 
That was some very good television, Josh, and I think four network news directors will 
bear me out on that tonight. 

JOSH 
I really think this isn’t as bad as you’re making it out to be.

C.J. 
A secwet pwan to fight infwation!

TOBY 
Okay, C.J., for a little while you’re gonna have to write it down.

SAM 
[bursts in] We have a problem.

TOBY 
No kidding!

SAM 
Not Josh.

JOSH 
Praise God.

SAM 
Although I’ve gotta say, telling a reporter his question’s stupid’s not like a page out 
of Dale Carnegie or anything.

JOSH 
Thank you.

TOBY 
What’s the problem?

SAM 
You’re not gonna like it.

TOBY 
Believe me, Sam, the only thing that could make my day worse is if Roberto Mendoza got 
involved.

Sam just looks at Toby, who rolls his eyes and rubs his head.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH 
Roberto Mendoza is the President’s nominee to fill Crouch’s seat on the Supreme Court. 
The President put Toby Ziegler in charge of his confirmation, which is a huge 
responsibility. A failed confirmation for the Court is a body blow to a presidency. 
Besides which, he’s a brilliant jurist and we badly want him on the bench. The 
confirmation process is a tough needle to thread. You gotta make a lot of friends and 
Supreme Court nominees don’t speak before their confirmation, they let the White House 
speak for them. Something Toby’s had a little bit of trouble teaching Roberto Mendoza.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
C.J., Toby, Sam and Josh are waiting. Leo walks in.

LEO 
He said the President was wrong?

C.J. 
He said the Pwesident was wong to make Secwetawy O’Weawy apowogize-

LEO 
What the hell is...?

TOBY 
C.J. Sam, tell him.

SAM 
He said the President was wrong to make Secretary O’Leary apologize.

LEO 
To who?

SAM 
To Wooden.

LEO 
I’m saying, to whom did he say it to?

TOBY 
Chicago Tribune.

LEO 
I thought he’s on vacation?

SAM 
He is.

LEO 
I thought he’s on vacation in Nova Scotia?

SAM 
He is.

LEO 
What, they called him in Nova Scotia?

SAM
Yeah.

LEO 
How the hell did they find him in Nova Scotia?

JOSH 
They have telephones in Nova Scotia, Leo. It’s not Amish country.

LEO
[glares at Josh] I really think of all the people in this building, Josh, you want to 
be the last person to speak right now.

JOSH 
You bet.

C.J. 
The Pwesident needs to be bwiefed on the events of the day.

TOBY 
C.J., so help me if you use the words “Pwesident” or “bwiefed” again.

LEO 
All right. The President lands in New Orleans in an hour and a half. There’ll be no 
press at the Labor Conference. And when he’s done he’s getting right back on the plane 
and coming home. Wheels down is 3:00 a.m. He’ll be back in the residence by 3:30. 
[starts to leave]

JOSH 
Can I say something?

LEO 
[annoyed, stops and turns back] What?!

JOSH 
A lot of this is our fault. And the President probably isn’t going to take this very well 
and we just want you to know that we will be there with you in spirit tomorrow morning.

LEO
You’re gonna be there with me in every way imaginable, Josh.

JOSH 
You bet.

LEO 
[to all] 7:00 a.m. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH 
If you read the papers, you know that this not the first time this had happened. In 
the eight weeks since the President named his nominee, Judge Mendoza has, on various 
occasions, publicly criticized the American Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, and the New 
York state legislature. Three organizations without which this President would not 
have been elected. Putting out the Deborah O’Leary fire from earlier in the day had 
been the only thing we’d been successful at, and now Judge Mendoza had... 

Josh's phone rings again.

JOSH [cont.]
...started it up again. I-I... I’m really very sorry, but I have to get this. 
[gets up and answers the phone] Yeah.

SAM 
Josh.

JOSH 
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. WESLEY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Sam updates Josh on what happened.

SAM 
We’re in.

JOSH 
Where is he?

SAM 
Toby’s talking to him now.

CUT TO: INT. WESLEY POLICE CELL - NIGHT
Officer Peter is letting Toby into the cell where Judge Mendoza is lying on a cot.

TOBY 
Hello Mr. Justice. How are you?

MENDOZA 
Incarcerated, Toby. How’re you?

OFFICER PETER 
Do you need anything, Mr. Ziegler?

TOBY 
No. Judge and I are gonna have a chat. [goes into the cell]

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

JOSH 
The hardest job in the White House is President. The second hardest job is not Chief 
of Staff, it’s not National Security Advisor, and it’s not Press Secretary, although 
I’m gaining a certain amount of respect for Press Secretaries. The second hardest job 
in the White House belongs to a 21 year old kid named Charlie Young. He’s what’s called 
the President’s body man, his personal aide. He’s with the President morning to night. 
He has a range of responsibilities, all of them difficult. But the one he hates most in 
this from time to time it is his job to wake the President up in the morning. And on 
this particular morning, the President had gone to sleep only three hours earlier.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Early that morning, Charlie is talking on the phone. The operator, Helen, answers.

HELEN 
Good morning, White House operator four. How may I direct your call?

CHARLIE 
Good morning, Helen. It’s Charlie.

HELEN 
Hey babe. How was New Orleans?

CHARLIE 
The President did very well.

HELEN 
Have you been to sleep yet?

CHARLIE 
Since when?

HELEN 
Since yesterday.

CHARLIE 
[laughs] Good one, Helen. It’s time for the President’s wake up call.

HELEN 
Lucky you. Let me put you through.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is asleep in his bedroom. The phone rings four times before he finally answers 
it sleepily.

BARTLET 
What?

CHARLIE 
Good morning, Mr. President. It’s Charlie. I hope...

BARTLET 
What could you possibly want right now?

CHARLIE 
Sir, it’s 6:30 a.m. and...

BARTLET 
In the morning?

CHARLIE 
Yes sir. And I wanted to remind you that...

BARTLET 
I mean, what in the name of everything holy could you want right now?

CHARLIE 
I wanted to remind you that you have a 7:00 a.m. at the Oval Office with senior staff, 
followed by your security and intelligence briefings, and a meeting with the Chairman 
of the Fed. Would you like me to have the stewards bring you some coffee and the 
Washington Post?

BARTLET 
Who the hell is this?

CHARLIE 
Sir.

BARTLET 
And what could you possibly want?

CHARLIE 
Sir. I need you to dig in now. It wasn’t a nightmare. You really are the President.

BARTLET 
All right.

CHARLIE 
I’ll have the stewards bring the coffee to your room.

BARTLET 
I’ll get up now. [hangs up the phone with difficulty]

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH 
Mendoza was summoned to the White House from his vacation in Nova Scotia. When you 
summon someone to the White House, you generally expect to see them within the hour. 
Judge Mendoza told us that he would see us in three days. Why three days? Because he 
was driving down to D.C., stopping in Connecticut to do some antiquing. Yet another 
thing we’d have to tell the President. Who, by the way, had still not woken up.

CUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE HALLWAY - DAY
Early that morning, Charlie comes around the corner to find BILLY, the steward, waiting 
outside the bedroom door.

BILLY 
Charlie.

CHARLIE 
Oh, come on.

BILLY
I’ve been knocking every few minutes or so, and I don’t hear the shower running either.

CHARLIE 
Thanks, Billy. Give me a minute, would you?

BILLY 
You bet.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Charlie goes into the bedroom and turns on a few lamps. He tries to wake up Bartlet.

CHARLIE 
Mr. President... Mr. President. [shakes the President] Mr. President...

BARTLET 
[wakes up and quickly grabs Charlie's wrist] Charlie, are you aware you’re committing 
a federal crime right now?

CHARLIE 
I’ll take my chances with the Feds, Mr. President. It’s seven o’clock.

BARTLET 
How did you know the First Lady wasn’t going to be naked when you came in here? 
[looks at her empty side of the bed] Come to think of it, where the hell is my wife?

CHARLIE 
Argentina.

BARTLET 
That’s right.

CHARLIE 
Senior staff at the Oval Office, sir. So I’m gonna stand here while you get outta bed, 
take a shower and get dressed. [holds up the President’s robe] 

BARTLET 
[finally gets up] Have you slept yet?

CHARLIE 
No sir.

BARTLET 
Good.

Charlie helps the President put on his robe.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
The senior staff are waiting inside.

JOSH 
[to C.J.] How’s your mouth?

C.J. 
Well, the swelling’s gone down. On the other hand, the painkillers have worn off.

LEO 
He’s driving from Nova Scotia to Washington?

SAM 
Yeah.

LEO 
How’s a person do that?

SAM 
Oh, my guess is, he’ll take the Trans-Canada Highway to New Brunswick, then maybe catch 
the 1 and take the scenic route along the coast of Maine. 95 through New Hampshire to 
the Mass Pike, and then cut over to the Merritt Parkway round Milford.

They all look at Sam like he’s crazy. Toby vocalizes it.

TOBY 
Something really kinda freakish about you, you know that?

Bartlet comes in from the Mural Room.

BARTLET 
I’m tired, I’m cranky, and my wife’s in Argentina. Let’s get this over with.

They all follow him into THE OVAL OFFICE, where Bartlet stands in front of his desk 
and they form a semi-circle around him. 

BARTLET 
What?

LEO 
Mr. President, we experienced a few public relations, what’s the word...?

TOBY 
Catastrophes?

LEO 
...incidents in the few hours you were away last night. 

BARTLET 
What kind of incidents?

Everyone looks at Josh, who is looking at his feet.

LEO 
Josh.

JOSH 
Yeah? [gets it] Oh. First, I’m happy to tell you that the incident involving Secretary 
O’Leary and Congressman Wooden has been dispensed with. Though not really, and I’ll get 
to that at the end. Sam asked C.J. to move the briefing to two o’clock so that we could 
fold in the teachers. C.J. had emergency root canal surgery at noon and so was unable 
to brief.

BARTLET 
Who did?

JOSH 
I did.

BARTLET 
Oh God.

JOSH 
Yeah. A long story short, you’re gonna be reading a bit today about your secret plan 
to fight inflation.

BARTLET 
I have a secret plan to fight inflation?

JOSH 
No.

BARTLET 
Why am I gonna be reading that I do?

JOSH 
It was suggested in the Press Room that you did.

BARTLET 
By who?

JOSH 
By me.

BARTLET 
You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?

JOSH 
No, I did not. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do that. Except, yes, I did that.

BARTLET 
Josh, I’m a little confused.

JOSH 
Sir, there was this idiotic round robin. It was sarcastic. There’s no way they didn’t 
know that. They were just mad at me for imposing discipline and calling them stupid!

BARTLET 
Okay, before we go on. C.J., if blood is gushing from the head wound you just received 
from a stampeding herd of bison, you’ll do the press briefing.

C.J. 
Yes sir.

JOSH 
Mr. President...

BARTLET 
A secret plan to fight inflation?

JOSH 
There was no turning them back. I denied it for half an hour. They wouldn’t take no 
for an answer.

BARTLET 
Were you clear?

JOSH 
I was crystal clear. They said, “Do you think if the President has a plan to fight 
inflation, it’s right that be keep it a secret?” I said, “Of course not!”

BARTLET 
Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but 
now you don’t support it?

JOSH 
[looks stunned] When you put it like that...

TOBY 
Mr. President, much as we’d love nothing more than to stand here and watch you beat 
the living crap outta Josh, there’s actually a bigger fish to fry.

BARTLET 
What did Mendoza do?

TOBY 
He told the Chicago Tribune that you were wrong to admonish Secretary O’Leary and 
make her apologize.

BARTLET 
I didn’t, he did. [points at Leo]

LEO 
You told me to.

BARTLET 
You said you were gonna fix it.

LEO 
I did fix it.

BARTLET 
It’s broken again, Leo.

TOBY 
Frankly sir, that’s ‘cause your nominee for the Supreme Court’s handling himself in a 
manner that’s totally unprofessional.

BARTLET 
We will have the first of what I think will a series of discussions about professionalism 
another time, Toby. Where is Mendoza?

SAM 
He’s on his way, sir.

BARTLET 
Right now?

SAM 
Yes, but he won’t be here until the day after tomorrow.

BARTLET 
Day after tomorrow?

SAM 
Yes sir.

BARTLET 
Is he coming in from Neptune?

SAM 
He’s vacationing with his wife and son, and they’d prefer to take a leisurely drive 
through eastern Canada and New England while stopping for some antique shopping in 
Connecticut. I imagine he’ll take the Trans-Canada Highway, the 95...

TOBY 
Sam.

BARTLET 
Okay. We will wait for Mendoza. In the meantime, C.J., you will untangle the Press Corps.

C.J.
Yes sir.

BARTLET 
And we will hope that nothing happens today to make this any worse. Although I certainly 
wouldn’t bet the house on it. That is all.

LEO 
Thank you, Mr. President.

They all leave, except for Josh, who hangs back as Bartlet sits at his desk.

JOSH 
Sir, I wanna tell you that I’m sorry and that this mess will be cleaned up in an adult 
and professional manner.

BARTLET 
Good.

JOSH 
[quietly] If anyone asks you, you quit smoking years ago, and the cigarette you bummed 
on Air Force One was for a friend.

BARTLET 
Get out.

JOSH 
You bet.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - PRESENT

JOSH 
And that was it.

NESSLER 
What happened to Judge Mendoza?

JOSH 
I’m sorry?

NESSLER 
Did he ever get here from Nova Scotia?

JOSH 
Actually, he’s on his way right now. He’s spending the night in Connecticut to do some 
antiquing.

CUT TO: INT. WESLEY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Sam just got coffee from a vending machine and is drinking.

SERGEANT McNAMARA
[nervously] He’s been in there a little while now.

SAM 
Yeah.

SERGEANT McNAMARA 
I’m the one that pulled him over, you know. His driving was erratic. Still not entirely 
convinced he hadn’t been drinking.

SAM 
Well, you have a problem there.

SERGEANT McNAMARA 
What’s that?

SAM 
Judge Mendoza has chronic persistent hepatitis, which is a non-progressive form of 
liver inflammation. If he’d had enough to drink to blow point one on the blood-alcohol, 
he’d be dead right now. [drinks] This is good coffee.

CUT TO: INT. WESLEY POLICE CELL - NIGHT
Toby is still having a word with Judge Mendoza.

TOBY 
Why didn’t you take a Breathalyzer?

MENDOZA 
Because I was driving within the speed limit, I was driving on the right side of the 
road, I had valid tags and registration and as far as I know, I don’t have any warrants 
for my arrest in Connecticut.

TOBY 
Judge...

MENDOZA 
Absent just cause, Toby. The Breathalyzer’s an illegal search. It’s a civil rights 
violation.

TOBY 
So you give Barney Fife a hard time to make a point. 

MENDOZA 
Point worth making.

TOBY 
Not now.

MENDOZA 
Yes now, right now.

TOBY 
One phone call, Judge. “Toby, this has happened. Tell ‘em my name’s Roberto Mendoza 
and the President’s named me to the bench!”

MENDOZA 
They pulled me over because I look like my name is Roberto Mendoza and I’m coming to 
rob your house.

TOBY 
Let’s go. [starts to leave]

MENDOZA 
Where are we going?

TOBY 
Home. Let’s go home!

MENDOZA 
I’m not going anywhere.

TOBY 
Judge.

MENDOZA 
I’m under arrest, Toby.

TOBY 
Not anymore. Let’s go.

MENDOZA 
You pull all the strings you want, Toby, but not for me. Come Monday, I’m gonna 
inveigle myself of the criminal justice system for which I have worked my entire 
adult life.

TOBY 
Judge, due respect. Get your things and let’s go. 

MENDOZA 
[angrily] My kid was in the car, Toby. They patted me down and they handcuffed me in 
front of my nine year old boy. Then he and his mother got to see them put me in the 
squad car and drive away.

TOBY 
He’s also seen you wearing a robe with a gavel in your hand.

MENDOZA 
He doesn’t understand that. He doesn’t know what that is. He understands what the 
police are because he watches television. That’s what he’s gonna remember, his father 
being handcuffed. So America just got another pissed-off guy with dark skin.

TOBY
Robbie and Laura, where are they right now?

MENDOZA
Motel a few miles...

TOBY
There’s nothing about this that doesn’t stink. If it were me, I’d wanna extract 
vengeance, and I’d say “Let justice be done.” I’d also wanna spend some time in a 
dark room alone, so that I didn’t have to face my wife and my son and have them see 
my humiliation. Rob, I can’t get this done if this is the story. Can’t get it done. 
Nothing about this that doesn’t stink. And nothing about it that wouldn’t be better 
if you were a Supreme Court Justice. Let me take you to the motel. Go see your boy.

CUT TO: INT. WESLEY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
In the lobby, Sam is playing with his coffee cup.

OFFICER PETER 
So, can I ask, a guy in your job, do you know missile codes and that sort of thing?

SAM 
Yeah.

OFFICER PETER 
Outstanding.

Toby and Mendoza come out of the back room.

SAM 
Good evening, Mr. Justice.

MENDOZA 
Good evening, Sam.

TOBY 
[to Officer Peter] You got personal items?

OFFICER PETER
Yes sir. 

He leaves to get Mendoza’s stuff.

TOBY 
Your lucky night, officers. There isn’t gonna be a report, there isn’t going to be 
an investigation, no one’s getting suspended. And no one’s filing a hundred million 
dollar lawsuit against the county that they would almost surely win. But in this room, 
you’re gonna apologize to Mr. Mendoza. And then you’re gonna get in your squad car and 
you’re gonna follow us and you’re gonna apologize to his son.

SERGEANT McNAMARA 
Judge Mendoza, we sincerely apologize for our mistake.

MENDOZA 
Thank you.

TOBY 
Let’s go.

Toby and Mendoza start to leave.

SAM 
I also gotta say, you guys could do a better job of marking the exits on the throughway.

TOBY
Let’s go!

SERGEANT MCNAMARA 
We’ll be behind you.

CUT TO: EXT. WESLEY POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
Sam, Toby and Mendoza are walking out of the police station, heading for their car.

MENDOZA 
You know what, Toby. If there’s no reason for you guys to go back to Washington, you 
should spend the night here.

TOBY 
[opens car door] What’s up here?

MENDOZA 
Great antiquing. [enters car]

TOBY 
Killing me, Judge. You’re absolutely killing me.

Toby closes the car door. Sam dials his phone.

SAM 
Josh.

JOSH 
Yeah.

SAM 
It’s over.

CUT TO: INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
Josh is standing to the back of the stage.

JOSH 
Good. [hangs up phone and sits back down] 
That’s the last time the phone will ring. I promise.

NESSLER 
Josh...

JOSH 
There’s a part of the story I didn’t tell you. I can’t. Trust me, it doesn’t involve... 
I-I-I just can’t right now. Ask me back again after the Senate confirms Mendoza. 
You really should hear it, it’s a good story.

NESSLER 
Why don’t we take some questions.

JOSH 
Yeah.

Josh turns to his audience.

Transcript By: Cindy Dechief



West Wing S01E16
President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and several of his staff head to Los Angeles for a whirlwind visit that is topped off by a star-studded fundraiser hosted by a wealthy film honcho, Ted Marcus (Bob Balaban) who threatens to cancel the bash unless Bartlet announces his opposition to a congressional bill banning gays in the military. Back in Washington, Leo (John Spencer) tries to convince a stubborn Vice President Hoynes (Tim Matheson) to break the Senate voting deadlock over an ethanol tax credit favored by the White House. Elsewhere, Josh (Bradley Whitford) learns that feisty campaign manager Joey Lucas (Marlee Matlin) is staying in his Los Angeles hotel and he eagerly anticipates seeing her again. The President takes a meeting where he is warned about not supporting an amendment banning flag-burning and checks up on Secret Service security for his daughter Zoey (Elisabeth Moss) -- and is unafraid to close down a restaurant where she's lunching. Jay Leno, Veronica Webb and David Hasselhoff guest star as celebrities attending the Hollywood bash.

2:38 A.M. EST

CUT TO: INT. BARTLET’S LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Leo are inside the limousine. It’s headed for the airport.

BARTLET
I don't like putting him in this position.

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him in this 
position.

LEO
Well, he knew the vote was going to be tight.

BARTLET
It's ironic.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
50-50 tie.

LEO
I understand the irony.

BARTLET
Are you being brusque with me?

LEO
It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

BARTLET
I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even number 
of senators.

LEO
Yeah, you should blame the constitution.

BARTLET
That's what I usually do.

LEO
Yep.

BARTLET 
[to Ron in front]
Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?

RON
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
[to Leo]
Zoey got a new agent on her detail.

LEO
I heard.

BARTLET
Have you seen these new agents?

LEO
I've seen them.

BARTLET
They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus strapped to a 
44 magnum.

LEO
They really blend in, huh?

BARTLET
Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending in. You 
want them wearing a sign that says, "I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the safety's off."

LEO
[pause] Can I say this one last time?

BARTLET
No.

LEO
If you get tired--

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
Stay at the hotel for the night.

BARTLET
I won't get tired.

LEO
You're not going to sleep on the plane, you're going to be running around all day, 
and then you've got the fundraiser to do at night.

BARTLET
I want to come home after the fundraiser.

LEO
That's a full day and night. Round trip, D.C. to L.A. in 24 hours. It's really no 
good for you.

BARTLET
It'll be fine.

LEO
[beat] Be that way.

BARTLET
Your impersonation of my mother is getting sharper and sharper, you know that?

LEO
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
The limo pulls up to the Air Force One on the tarmac. Bartlet and Leo step out.

LEO
Have a good flight, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'll see you tomorrow. 

He sees C.J. and Charlie, who are walking up to the limo. They join him in walking up 
the stairs to the plane. 

BARTLET
C.J.! Charlie! My flying companions!

C.J.
Good morning, Mr. President.

CHARLIE
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Is everybody on board?

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Press in a good mood?

C.J.
No, Mr. President, I wouldn't say they were.

BARTLET
Why not?

C.J.
Well, they're not wild about taking off at 3 0'clock in the morning, sir.

BARTLET
Oh, it's going to be great. We're going to race the sun to the pacific horizon!

C.J.
I'll be sure to tell them that, sir. I'm sure it'll pick them right up.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet, followed by C.J. and Charlie, enters Air Force One, walking down the aisle 
as he talks to people.

BARTLET
Morning, Everyone. Sam, it's going to be 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit.

SAM
I can still make a couple of calls.

BARTLET
Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50.

Josh and Toby join Bartlet as he walks down the aisle.

TOBY
Sir, Josh and I would at least like the opportunity to talk about the Al Kiefer 
meeting.

BARTLET
You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.

JOSH
Sir.

Bartlet stops and picks up the intercom phone on the wall of the plane.

BARTLET 
We'll listen to him, Josh.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You two want to see the best part about having my job? 
[into the Intercom] Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go.

The engines fire up as Bartlet hangs up the phone.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
3:45 AM EST
C.J. and Donna chat in their seats, camera slowly pans to see Josh, Toby and Sam 
sitting next and across from them, Josh and Sam hunkered in and eyes shut, but not
necessarily asleep.

DONNA
It's fantastic. It's Clinique's city block oil for daily face protector.

C.J.
SPF-15?

DONNA
I brought the SPF-15 and the SPF-30.

C.J.
Have you tried the Lancome high-protection sunstick for face and lips?

DONNA
No, did you bring it?

C.J.
Plus the Elizabeth Arden modern skin care daily moisturizer.

TOBY
The two of you understand that we're going to be in California for one day?

C.J.
There's tanning time between 2 and 4.

DONNA
And I have sensitive alabaster skin.

C.J.
Me too.

JOSH
Cameron’s going to introduce a bill tomorrow.

SAM 
[eyes still shut] Gays in the military?

JOSH
Yup.

C.J.
It's Cameron. Who cares?

JOSH
I have a feeling Ted Marcus might care.

SAM
He's not going to know.

JOSH
He might.

TOBY
You've been in the air all night, you don't know anything, you'll get back to him.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Plus, it's Cameron. So, who cares?

JOSH
Marcus is going to care.

CHARLIE 
[walking up] C.J., you wanted me to let you know when it looked like he was heading 
for the cockpit?

C.J.
Thank you. [getting up] This man has got to be stopped!

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Zoey is reading on a couch. Charlie sits down next to her.

CHARLIE
How you doing?

ZOEY
Hi.

CHARLIE
Listen, uh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to be as attentive on this trip as 
you would like.

ZOEY
That's okay. You’re working.

CHARLIE
Well, I've been trying to listen to some of the many lessons you've been giving me on 
how to be a better boyfriend and I know that attentiveness--

ZOEY
No, this is one of the times when it's okay.

CHARLIE
Okay. It's hard to tell the difference between those times and the other times.

ZOEY
I know. Doesn't that suck for you?

CHARLIE
A little bit, yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Ron Butterfield is escorting a woman to Bartlet's cabin.

RON
Don't be nervous.

WOMAN
Yeah.

Ron knocks on the door.

BARTLET [OS]
Come on in.

Inside THE PRESIDENT’S ROOM, Bartlet is sitting at his desk as Ron and the woman, 
Special Agent GINA TOSCANO, enter.

RON
Mr. President, this is special agent Gina Toscano.

BARTLET 
[shaking her hand] How do you do?

GINA TOSCANO
How do you do, Mr. President?

RON
I'll step out, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you, Ron.

Ron exits.

BARTLET
[to Gina] I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been with 
Zoey's detail, what?

GINA
Two weeks today, sir.

BARTLET
You were in the army?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How did you get there?

GINA
I was Army ROTC.

BARTLET
Where?

GINA
University of Virginia.

BARTLET
You were a Mountaineer.

GINA
That's West Virginia, Mr. President. I'm a Cavalier.

BARTLET
With a degree in?

GINA
Criminology, sir.

BARTLET
So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?

GINA
Yes, sir, with military police.

BARTLET
How old are you?

GINA
I'm 27, sir.

BARTLET
How long have you trained for this assignment?

GINA
A year and a half, sir.

BARTLET
What, were you the first one to sign up?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
All right.

Gina sits down.

BARTLET
You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You know about the letters?

GINA
Of course, sir.

BARTLET
Are they white supremacists?

GINA
I can't tell you for sure, Mr. President. We've been working fairly closely with the 
Southern Poverty Law Center and their database.

BARTLET
You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?

GINA
Not much of either one, Mr. President, but I know what I'm looking for in a crowd if 
that's what you're asking me, sir.

BARTLET
It is.

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and 
I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be 
comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's 
not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if 
she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing 
with her friends. You know what your job is.

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

GINA
[gets up and shakes his hand] Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Gina?

GINA
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it.

GINA
No deal, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet smiles as Gina exits.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Larry and Ed are following Leo to his office.

LEO [VO]
We didn't say it enough.

LARRY
We agree.

LEO
Ethanol accounts for 20 percent of Iowa's corn crop.

ED
Which doesn't mean a lot outside of Iowa. 

LARRY
But still. 

ED
The Ethanol tax credit created... 

LARRY
It created 16,000 new jobs.

LEO
That's what we never said enough.

LARRY
We agree. Is it over?

LEO
Sam's been calling senators from the plane for the past hour and a half. The next time 
my phone rings, it's going to be him telling me it's over.

ED
At least we're going to win. 

LEO
Yeah. 

Margaret enters the LEO'S OFFICE as Larry and Ed exit. 

LEO
Good morning. 

MARGARET
Good morning, Leo. You need to sign this. 

LEO 
[signs] Okay.

MARGARET
And this. 

LEO 
[signs] Okay. 

MARGARET
Where it says your name, Leo. You're not the Belgian Foreign Minister. 

LEO
Look, I said I was sorry. 

MARGARET
I'm not upset. 

LEO
I had to stay behind for this. 

MARGARET
Of course. 

LEO
There will be other trips, Margaret. 

MARGARET
I know. [Leo looks at her] There will be other trips. 

LEO
Good. 

MARGARET
Just not to California. 

LEO
Yes, to California. 

MARGARET
When? 

LEO
They've got 54 electoral votes out there. Something tells me that we're not going to 
be strangers. 

The phone rings. Margaret answers.

everyone on the President's schedule. The President will be greeted at the airport by 
Congressmen Hark and Jennsen, the Mayor and various City Council Members. It's photos 
only, no formal remarks. We will depart the airport at 6:20 and head for the hotel, at 
which point I predict that we will no longer be on schedule.

roped-off area outside, unless you've got $50,000 a couple to take a look at the good 
stuff. Welcome to Los Angeles, where the local time is 5:40 AM, and the temperature is... 
ooh, a balmy 73 degrees. 

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY
Josh is trying to get his door open at the hotel. Donna walks up as he's struggling with 
his card key. 

DONNA
Josh. 

JOSH
Yeah. 

DONNA
Need any help with your luggage, there? 

JOSH
No, you're fine. 

Donna arrives with a few small paper slips, while Josh struggles with the door handle. 

DONNA
There were messages for you at the desk. 

JOSH
I've spent half the nights in my life in hotel rooms, and I still cannot... 

DONNA
Dave Levy. 

JOSH
Later. You sure this isn't for your room? 

DONNA
It's for your room. Mandy? 

JOSH
Ugh, later. You sure? 

DONNA
It's for your room. The deputy whip? 

JOSH
Later. You know, there used to be keys... 

DONNA
Hold on. [takes the card from him and sticks it in the door.] 

JOSH
You stuck it in, you turned it, you... 

Donna opens the door easily.

JOSH
I loosened it for you. 

Inside the HOTEL ROOM, Josh gets settled in. 

DONNA
Ron Dreyfuss from political affairs. 

JOSH
Later. 

DONNA
Joey Lucas. 

JOSH
Really? 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
She called? 

DONNA
Yes. 

JOSH
She's here. 

DONNA
In this hotel. 

JOSH
She's here in this hotel. 

DONNA
Yes. She's at the fundraiser tonight. 

JOSH
Really. 

DONNA
Yes. 

JOSH
Why did she call? 

DONNA
To tell you that she's here in this hotel and she's coming to the fundraiser tonight. 

JOSH
Really. 

DONNA
Yes. 

JOSH
Huh. 

DONNA
Josh, you've got a crush on Joey Lucas, and I really think you should do something about 
it, because you're starting to bother me. 

JOSH
Well, that's something I really care about. 

DONNA
Call her right now. 

JOSH
I'll see her tonight. 

DONNA
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Josh. Do you know what that means? It means you should 
take this time to gather rosebuds, because later on you might not be able to. 

JOSH
Interpreting the classics with Poet Laureate Donnatella Moss. 

DONNA
I'm just saying, call her and stop bugging me. 

JOSH
So, let's call her.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah. Let's do it. Call her, and then we'll do everyone else. 

DONNA
I have alabaster skin, you know. 

JOSH
Dial the phone. 

DONNA
I'm just saying. Also, Ted Marcus called. 

JOSH
What? 

DONNA
Ted Marcus called. 

JOSH
Hang on. [beat] I'd better call him first.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. TED MARCUS' MANSION - DAY
8:05 AM, PST
A taxi pulls up to a large mansion in Bel Air. Josh gets out the taxi as TED MARCUS 
walks down the long flight of stairs and exits the house to greet him. 

JOSH
Good morning. You beat me to the door. 

Josh extends his hand. MARCUS ignores it, and turns to go back into the house. Josh 
follows him, looking around in wonder. 

TED MARCUS
Cameron introduced his resolution on the floor this morning. 

JOSH
I didn't know that. 

MARCUS
House Resolution 973. 

JOSH
This is a beautiful house. 

MARCUS
Banning gays in the military. 

JOSH
I've been on a plane all night. 

MARCUS
He introduced it on the floor this morning.

JOSH
Seriously, Studio Chairman -- nice work if you can get it. 

MARCUS
Josh, let's not talk about my house.

JOSH
What do you want to talk about? 

MARCUS
What do I want to talk about? 

JOSH
Ted, I checked into my hotel room 15 minutes ago, what did you haul my ass out here for? 

MARCUS
I think you'd better watch your general tone with me, I'm sending you home tomorrow with 
two and a half million dollars. 

They reach the back of the house, where workers are preparing for the evening fundraiser.

JOSH
Cameron's bill is a joke.

MARCUS
Not to me. 

JOSH
It's the House. It's procedure. Do you know how many bills get introduced every day that 
never get a hearing, let alone a vote? 

MARCUS
That's it? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

MARCUS
You came to me with that? 

JOSH
I came to you because you told me to, now I've got a cab waiting outside... 

MARCUS
Yeah, you're right. 

JOSH
Don't worry about it. 

MARCUS
I'm being silly. 

JOSH
You're worried about nothing. I'll see you later. The President's looking forward to 
the party this evening. 

MARCUS
Excellent. 

Josh turns to leave.

MARCUS
[to workers] Fellas, you can pack it up, the party's off. 

JOSH
Ted. Ted? 

MARCUS
Everybody, Carmine, I'm afraid it's not going to happen. 

CARMINE
The food, the flowers? 

MARCUS
Give 'em out to the guys. 

JOSH
You're a rotten bluffer, Ted. 

MARCUS
You're right, that's why I never do it. 

JOSH
You're not going to cancel the fundraiser. 

MARCUS
In fact, I already did. 

JOSH
This is the President. 

MARCUS
The President is going to be eating room service tonight. 

JOSH
Ted. 

MARCUS
You've got a cab waiting. 

JOSH
That was abrupt. I apologize. 

MARCUS
Your apology is accepted. 

JOSH
You can't cancel the fundraiser. 

MARCUS
Yet, witness the loading of the trucks. 

JOSH
This is ridiculous. You're going to be a joke to our people. 

MARCUS
Disrespected by the Democratic Party? Whatever will I do? 

JOSH
Ted. 

MARCUS
Particularly with my 3 billion dollars. 

JOSH
Ted, no one is going to pass a bill banning gays in the military. And if the House ever 
passed such a bill, if the Senate every passed such a bill, the President would never 
sign such a bill. 

MARCUS
Fantastic. 

JOSH
Okay? 

MARCUS
Fantabulous. 

JOSH
So, you're not going to flake on me. 

MARCUS
We're fine. 

JOSH
So, the party's still on? 

MARCUS
You bet. 

JOSH
Good. 

MARCUS
As soon as I hear the President say what you just said to me. 

JOSH
Look-- 

MARCUS
Give me a call and let me know what time I should be tuned to my television to hear 
him say what you just said. 

JOSH
That's not going to happen, and you know it. 

MARCUS
Then we've got a problem. Don't screw around with me, Josh. I've been President a lot 
longer than he has. 

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is in his office, looking over papers. Margaret enters. 

MARGARET
Leo. 

LEO
Yeah. 

MARGARET
The Vice President. 

HOYNES
[enters] Morning, Leo. 

LEO
Good morning, Mr. Vice President. 

HOYNES
Still 50-50, huh? 

LEO
That's the way it's going to stay. 

HOYNES
Did you talk to Huntington? 

LEO
We talked to Huntington. We talked to Gianelli. We talked to Kelly, and Martinson, 
and Rathburn. 

HOYNES
Recently? 

LEO
This morning. Nobody's moving. 

HOYNES
Well, it kind of looked like it was going to turn out that way. 

LEO
Not to me. I was surprised. 

HOYNES
Well, I was in the Senate with 94 of these guys. 

LEO
Anyway. 

HOYNES
Yeah. 

LEO
The President needs you to go down there and fulfill one of your two constitutional 
responsibilities and vote for the ethanol tax credit. We need you to break the tie. 
He also wanted me to tell you that he regrets putting you in this position. 

HOYNES
You got to get me off the hook, Leo. You can't ask me to do this. 

LEO
John, I know exactly how you feel. 

HOYNES
No, Leo, I don't think you do. 

LEO
I know... 

HOYNES
I spent 8 years in the Senate voting against this exact tax credit. I was right, by the 
way, and I'm still right, but the point is... 

LEO
16,000 new jobs. 4 billion dollars invested in plants and equipment, because the tax 
credit made it economical. 

HOYNES
Leo, the ethanol tax credit has accomplished exactly none of its goals. Production is 
close to nothing. It will never be large enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
And it requires substantial energy to produce, which totally washes out any overall 
conservation effect. 

LEO
John? 

HOYNES
But that's not the point. 

LEO
What's the point? 

HOYNES
The Republicans will make me eat it for dinner when my time comes. And you know that. 
So let's get serious. 

CUT TO: INT. A HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
In a conference room in Orange County, a gray-haired man speaks from the head of the 
table. They are having the discussion about the flag burning amendment. 

MAN 1
Mr. President, I rise today to say that the American flag is probably the most recognized 
symbol in the world. Wherever it stands, it represents freedom. Millions of American 
citizens, who have served our nation in war, have carried that flag into battle. They 
have been killed just for wearing it on their uniforms, because it represents the most 
feared deterrent to tyranny. And that is liberty. 

Bartlet and others clap. 

MAN 2 
[stands] Mr. President, This is not a perfect nation, but to the world outside, it 
represents what is right. And to Americans, it represents what Chief Justice Charles 
Evans Hughes... [Josh, Toby and Sam walk out the door to a courtyard.] ...referred to 
as our national unity, our national endeavor. 

CUT TO: EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Josh, Toby and Sam stand by the fence. 

JOSH
I just came from Ted Marcus's. 

TOBY
What did he want? 

JOSH
He's threatening to cancel tonight unless the President comes out publicly against 973. 

SAM
This is one of Cameron's... 

TOBY
It's not going anywhere. 

JOSH
I explained that. 

SAM
And what did he say? 

JOSH
He takes it seriously for obvious reasons, and he is distressed by the President's silence 
on the subject, and he feels that it's a betrayal of the gay community for him to be so 
publicly supportive of the President. 

TOBY
All right. It is not in the interest of his cause for the President to make a public 
statement today. It'll give credibility and attention... 

JOSH
Right. 

SAM
And use all those words when you talk to him. Tell him that surely a man of his media 
savvy will understand that the President can't be quite so publicly blackmailed! 

TOBY
And, should the President choose to stay in his hotel room tonight and not kowtow to the 
Hollywood blah, blah, blah, it will only serve to solidify his public reputation with the 
electorate as a man of character. 

SAM
Frankly, that buys us more than 2 and a half million dollars worth of support, anyway. 

TOBY
Use those words, and tell him if he goes ahead with the party, he gets 10 minutes alone 
in a room with the President. 

JOSH
All right, I can sell that. 

SAM
Let's go back. 

JOSH
How's he doing in there? 

SAM
Oh, he's got that look on his face like he's thinking about ways to kill himself. 

CUT TO: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet has that exact look on his face as a woman speaks. 

WOMAN
It is disgraceful that some individuals would desecrate the flag that our nation's 
veterans fought so valiantly to protect. [More applause as she sits.]

MAN 3
Mr. President, it is imperative that we enact legal protections... [Charlie walks over 
to Bartlet and whispers in his ear] ...for our flag, and I rise in strong support for 
the flag desecration constitutional amendment. 

BARTLET
I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate that is 
obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures, and the U.S. 
House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems to focus so 
much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this 
question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware of? 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Secret Service Agents open the doors as Bartlet and his staff walk outside to the limos. 

BARTLET
I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no one's kept 
me posted on? 

TOBY
There is not, so let's blow off the Kiefer meeting. 

BARTLET
Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer. 

TOBY
I don't. 

BARTLET
Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch. 

JOSH
I have to eat with Al Kiefer? 

BARTLET
Back at the Hotel. 

JOSH
Sir. 

BARTLET
Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch? 

CHARLIE
A place in Santa Monica called the Playa Cantina?

BARTLET
Why? 

CHARLIE
She wanted an L.A. experience, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
That supposed to be a good place, Sam? 

SAM
Uh, they make guacamole right in front of you. 

BARTLET
Is that an L.A. experience? 

CHARLIE
I think she meant the people. 

BARTLET
Well, there aren't going to be any people today. 

CHARLIE
Will you be joining her, sir? 

BARTLET
Sounds like fun, doesn't it? 

CHARLIE
Sir, wouldn't it be easier back at the hotel? 

BARTLET
Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me. 

CHARLIE
How much do you want to bet they would? 

JOSH
Sir, I need a minute to talk about Ted Marcus. 

BARTLET
We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo? 

SAM
He's with the Vice President now, sir. 

BARTLET
You come in the car, too. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
BARTLET, his staff and his agents come out of the building. Outside are a few screaming, 
cheering people holding signs. 

TOBY
Sir, this lunch with Al Kiefer? 

BARTLET 
[looks at a group across the street] Those people over there don't like me too much. 

JOSH
Well, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you like we have, sir. 

BARTLET
You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on, endangering 
countless lives in this country. 

TOBY
Don't put too much stock in what he has to say. 

BARTLET
I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with Kiefer, and 
let me know what's worth listening to. 

TOBY
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
[to Toby] We'll see you there. 

TOBY
What, I'm not coming in the car? 

BARTLET
No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole. 

TOBY
I didn't! 

BARTLET
I could tell you were thinking it. 

TOBY
Fair enough. 

BARTLET
Good. 

Toby walks away as Bartlet and the others get into the limousine.

FADE OUT. 
END ACT TWO 
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE PLAYA CANTINA - DAY
1:20 PM, PST
The restaurant is empty except for the staff and Secret Service Agents. Sam, Toby, Josh 
and C.J. sit at one table with AL KIEFER. Bartlet and Zoey sit alone at a table nearby. 

ZOEY
Dad, I can't believe you did this. 

BARTLET
Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best. 

ZOEY
Dad, I wanted to have lunch in Los Angeles-- 

BARTLET
You are. 

ZOEY
With people, with L.A. people. I wanted the atmosphere. And they've cleared out the place. 

BARTLET
Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us. 

ZOEY
Dad!

BARTLET
This is father/daughter fun time. 

ZOEY
I was having fun. And then you come within 100 meters of me, and my protection, like, 
quadruples. 

BARTLET
Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that. [looks around] Now that you mention it, yeah, 
I think you're right. 

ZOEY
What, is someone after me in California? 

BARTLET
All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway shootings, 
brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning going on, 
and you don't want a piece of that. 

ZOEY
See, you think you're funny. 

BARTLET
Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about that? 

A MOVING SHOT to the table next to them. Al Kiefer speaks.

AL KIEFER
On the flag burning, the bottom line couldn't be clearer. If he says nothing, he takes 
a hit, but not a fatal one. If he stands in opposition to the amendment, you can all 
start updating your resumes. 

SAM
I don't buy that. 

TOBY
Me, neither. 

C.J.
People respect a President who stands by the courage of his convictions. 

JOSH
Al. 

AL
You are looking at this exactly the wrong way. You don't have to play defense. You 
could lead the charge. 

TOBY
You just said that we couldn't. 

AL
No, I didn't. 

SAM
You just said that if we were vocal in our opposition to flag burning, then we'd take 
a fatal hit. 

AL
That's right. And I'm saying don't stay quiet, and don't oppose it. Lead the charge 
the other way. 

C.J. 
[laughing] What? 

BARTLET
C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet? 

C.J.
We'll let you know, sir. 

AL
Mr. President, do you want to sew up reelection right now? Do you want a lock on your 
second term right here, right now in this room? 

BARTLET
What do you got? 

JOSH
Why do you encourage him? 

BARTLET
What do you got, Al? 

AL
A truckload of voters, Mr. President, about 47%. Overwhelmingly white men, pool and 
patio types. Who voted against you by 20 plus points? [suddenly moves over to Bartlet's 
table.] They share an affinity towards authority, a President. And they see you as 
smart and having vision, so why didn't they vote for you? Because they also see you 
as a wimp. Two-thirds of them on a thermometer place you as some degree of weak. 

JOSH
We've heard these numbers before. 

BARTLET
Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my 
daughter. 

AL
Look, I get that this is not the most popular idea in the room. But I got numbers, 
and I know numbers, and I trust numbers. And the reason you're all looking a little 
pale right now is so do you. This is not theoretical. The flag burning amendment 
made it through the House with 20 votes over the required two-thirds. It hasn't made 
it through the Senate yet, but that day will come, that day will come, that day will 
come soon. Laws against flag burning are favored overwhelmingly in the polls, and a 
constitutional amendment won't be subject to a Presidential veto, or overturning by 
the Supreme Court. 

TOBY
Look... 

AL
This all adds up to one thing, Mr. President. It's over! The game's been played and 
won. But because of guys like me, you get the results before anyone else does, so you 
get to pick which side you're on. And not only do we get to be on the winning team, 
we get to lead the winning team. 

Josh's phone rings. He walks away from the table.

JOSH
Excuse me. 

AL
Toby, you're smiling. 

TOBY
I just figured out who you were.

AL
He's going to say Satan. 

TOBY
No. You're the guy that runs into 7-Eleven to get Satan a pack of cigarettes. 

CHARLIE
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Yeah, Charlie. [to the others] We'll talk about this later. [tightens his tie and 
gets up] 

TOBY
We will? 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE PLAYA CANTINA - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and his staff are leaving the restaurant, via more screaming, cheering crowds. 

JOSH
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Men with pools and patios think I'm weak. 

JOSH
I don't want to mention the 49 times we asked you not to take this meeting. 

BARTLET
Was that Marcus on the phone? 

JOSH
Speaking of natives, we sold him on 10 minutes in a room alone with you, tonight. 

BARTLET
No way I can get out of it? 

JOSH
Ten minutes. 

BARTLET
I used to like parties, you know that? 

As Bartlet gets in his car, Gina and Zoey are just leaving the restaurant. 

ZOEY
I just wanted a regular lunch, you know? In a restaurant, with people? My father sees 
danger behind the curtains. 

Gina spots two skinhead boys watching them. 

GINA
Hey, Zoey, do me a favor and walk on the other side of me, would you? 

ZOEY
Gina... 

GINA
Let's get in the car, okay? 

Gina, one hand on her gun, escorts Zoey into the car, and then knocks on the roof 
once she's in.

CUT TO: EXT. TED MARCUS'S MANSION - NIGHT
The fundraiser has started. Secret Service agents with dogs comb the lower lawn, 
while people party between light strings and flowers. 

CUT TO: INT. INSIDE THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS
Violinists play at the top of the stairwell. C.J. and Toby are at the bottom. 

C.J.
Look at this house! 

TOBY
Yeah. 

C.J.
I mean, look at this house! 

TOBY
It's a nice house. 

C.J.
You know, you haven't said anything about my dress. 

TOBY
You look very nice. 

C.J.
You're not even looking. 

TOBY
I'm looking at the house. 

A Hollywood-type man, MARK MILLER, walks up to them. 

MARK MILLER
Excuse me, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Mark Miller. I'm head of new development 
at Paragon. 

C.J.
C.J. Cregg. 

TOBY
Toby Ziegler. 

MARK
Oh, it's good to meet you both. C.J., I was wondering if my money buys me a few words 
alone with you. 

TOBY
Throw in a box of chocolates and a pair of nylons, get you a lot more than that. 

C.J.
Sure. 

C.J. and Mark start to walk off. 

TOBY
I'll be over at the bar, drinking a lot, if anyone wants me. 

C.J.
Nobody will.

Toby holds up his glass as Mark and C.J. walk through the house. 

MARK
I'll come right out and say it, C.J. I'm a big fan. 

C.J.
Thank you. 

MARK
Yeah. And I think that there's a place for you in our company. 

C.J.
Doing what? 

MARK
Development. 

C.J.
Of what? 

MARK
Development of projects. 

C.J.
What's that mean? 

MARK
You'd be developing feature projects. 

C.J.
Movies. 

MARK
Yeah. 

C.J.
You know what? You want Toby or Sam. I'm not a writer. 

MARK
Oh, no, we have writers. 

C.J.
Well, I certainly can't direct or act. 

MARK
No, you'd just be in development. 

C.J.
And what's that? 

MARK
Shepherding projects - developing them. 

C.J.
I thought a guy writes a movie, and a guy directs a movie. 

MARK
Sure. 

C.J.
And in between there are designers and technicians and actors. 

MARK
Yes. 

C.J.
So, tell me what I do again? 

MARK
Development. 

C.J.
Okay. Well, at the moment I have a pretty good job and I understand what it is, so, 
uh, I sure appreciate... [spots Sam walking past] Sam! [to Mark] I appreciate it, Mark, 
I'm sorry, I've got to talk to Sam about a thing the President wants me to... [She 
walks away with Sam.] Pretend you're talking to me. 

SAM
I am talking to you. 

C.J.
Walk me outside. 

SAM
Did he offer you a development...?

C.J.
Yes! 

SAM
Me, too. Do you know what it is? 

C.J.
No. 

SAM
Me, neither. 

Sam and C.J. move out of camera range as they walk past DAVID HASSELHOFF, talking to 
Donna and Josh near the pool. 

DAVID HASSELHOFF
"I think there's a basic bedrock principle behind the first amendment. That the 
government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea just because it's disagreeable." 
Justice William Brennan, writing for the majority. 

DONNA
I'm a real big fan, David, not just a Johnny-come-lately. It's not just Baywatch and 
Knight Rider with me. 

DAVID
Well, thank you very much. My point is... 

DONNA
I mean, Nick Fury, Panic at Malibu Pier, the Cartier Affair. Pleasure Cove, for crying 
out loud. 

JOSH 
[dragging Donna away] Excuse us. 

DONNA 
[to Josh, about David] He's so into me. 

JOSH
You're frightening the guests. 

DONNA
David Hasselhoff, I'm just saying. 

JOSH
He's married. 

DONNA
This is California, Josh. A girl can dream. 

JOSH 
[taking her glass] Stop drinking now. 

DONNA
Matt Perry, right there, goodbye. [wanders off.]

CUT TO: INT. TED MARCUS'S MANSION - NIGHT
Josh is waking along the pool, amidst the people, as a man calls him from behind. 

MAN
Josh! 

JOSH
I know that voice. 

Josh turns around to see Joey and her interpreter, Kenny. 

JOEY [KENNY]
How long was it going to take for you to say hello to me? 

JOSH
I got your phone message this morning, but I've been kind of running around. I didn't 
see you until now. 

JOEY [KENNY]
I saw you. 

JOSH
Well, then you should have said hello to me. 

JOEY [KENNY]
You looked like you were absorbed in high-level conversations. 

JOSH
I can assure you, I was not. 

JOEY [KENNY]
Well, then. 

JOSH
Well then, what? 

JOEY
Hello? 

JOSH
Hello! [chuckles] Look, uh, we're just here for the day... 

TOBY 
[walking past] Josh! 

JOSH
Uh, yeah. [to Joey] Can you not, uh, not, uh, just don't leave the party, okay? 

JOEY [KENNY]
Okay. 

Josh gives her a thumbs up, and follows Toby.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT
Leo escorts Hoynes to his car out front of a building. 

LEO
John, I know we've had our ups and downs, but let me be your guy here for a second. 
You can't be thinking about being the first vice president in history to break a tie 
going the other way. 

HOYNES
I'm not looking to make history. 

LEO
Then what are you looking for, John? You're going to get ink either way. 

HOYNES
Leo. 

LEO
I know that it eats at you that there is friction between you and my staff. You think 
they don't respect you. And they do. They just don't trust you. And frankly, neither 
does the President. 

HOYNES
Well... 

LEO
I mean I know that's tough. But God, John, I'm the one that convinced him to put you 
on the ticket. And I'm going to be the one standing here when you make history, whether 
you're going to or not. 

HOYNES
Leo, one of these days you're going to have to allow for the possibility that my motives 
might not always be sinister. You are your staff are remarkably smug, and frankly so is 
the President. And the fact that you think I give a damn that there is some friction 
between me and your staff is certainly proof enough of that. 

LEO
John, you will not be able to set foot in the West Wing. You will not be on the ticket 
in three years. 

HOYNES
Leo, I think you guys set me up. 

LEO
You think the President of the United States can arrange for a 50-50 tie in the Senate? 

HOYNES
I think the President of the United States can do pretty much whatever he wants. 

LEO
You're wrong. 

HOYNES
Well. Where's the President right now? 

LEO
At Ted Marcus's fundraiser. 

HOYNES
I think it's time for you to call him. [gets inside his limousine]

FADE IN: INT. PRIVATE AREA IN THE MANSION - NIGHT
11:05PM EST 
Leo and Bartlet are talking on the phone. Leo is alone in his office in the White 
House, while Bartlet is in a private room at the party with Josh, Toby and Sam, who 
is holding the receiver so he can talk to Leo.

BARTLET
We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo. 

LEO
Well, when you run out of reasons, the last reason is that you can't fire the Vice 
President. 

BARTLET
I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass. 

LEO
Mr. President, I got to tell you something and you won't like the sound of it. 

BARTLET
What? 

LEO
He's right, and we're wrong. 

BARTLET
About what? 

LEO
About the ethanol tax credit. 

SAM
Mr. President, Leo's right. 

BARTLET
Sam's weighing in. 

SAM
Sir, I put Cambridge, Aiello and Dane in a headlock to vote our way, let's send them 
back. We'll lose 53-47 and we can take the Vice President off the hook. 

BARTLET
All right, let's do what Sam said. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it. 

LEO
Sir, the thing about the Vice President in this situation... 

BARTLET
I'll call him from the plane. [hangs up] Christ, will this damn day never end? 

CUT TO: INT. A PATIO IN THE MANSION - NIGHT
VERONICA WEBB and JAY LENO are talking on the patio. 

VERONICA
Jay, you can't drive all those cars you have! 

JAY
Well, no, not all at once. 

VERONICA
I know not all at once, baby, but you have - 

C.J. walks up to them. 

JAY
Claudia Jean, this is Veronica Webb. 

C.J.
C.J. Cregg. 

VERONICA
Well, hi. Nice to meet you. 

C.J.
Nice to meet you, too. Jay, can I talk to you for a second? 

JAY
Uh, sure. 

VERONICA
Sure. 

C.J. and Jay walk and talk. 

C.J.
Uh, Jay, the President appreciates your laying off Leo McGarry the past few months. 
It hasn't gone unnoticed. 

JAY
Hey, you guys give me monologue material every night, you know. 

C.J.
Well, if there's anything I can do for you... 

JAY
You know what would be great? If you could get the President to drive his bike into 
a tree again. See, that's my bread and butter. That's what I live on. 

C.J. 
[laughing] You're a very funny boy, Jay. [looks over at another woman] How does she 
look like that? 

JAY
Uh, clean living. Prayer. 

WOMAN'S VOICE [OS]
C.J.? C.J.! 

C.J. 
[to Jay] I got to go. 

A woman walks up to C.J. Sam is right in front of her.

C.J.
[to the woman] Sorry, there's thing I've got to talk to Sam about... [takes Sam's 
arm and leads him away] Just pretend that you're talking to me again. 

SAM
Okay. This time, let's use code names. 

C.J.
Where's Josh? 

SAM
He's over there talking to that woman. 

C.J.
Interesting. 

SAM
Of course, it's just possible that they could just be pretending to be talking. 

C.J.
Indeed. 

Josh is sitting with Joey and Kenny at a table on the other side of the pool.

JOSH
So, you want to know what we did for lunch today? 

JOEY [KENNY]
What? 

JOSH
We had a meeting with a democratic pollster who told us that we could sew up 
reelection if the President led the charge in favor a flag burning amendment. 

JOEY [KENNY]
I heard. 

JOSH
How'd you hear? 

JOEY [KENNY]
I hear everything. [on Josh's quizzical look] It was a stupid joke. But I don't 
even get a sympathy laugh? 

JOSH 
[chuckling] Seriously... this guy had some pretty scary numbers. 

Sam, Toby and C.J. stop at their table. 

C.J.
Josh, I think I just made a three-picture deal. 

JOSH
Three-picture deal doing what? 

C.J.
It doesn't seem to matter. 

JOSH
This is Joey Lucas. This is her assistant Kenny. 

SAM
You're running O'Dwyer's campaign in the 46th. 

JOEY
Yes. 

SAM
Sam Seaborn. 

JOEY
Hi. 

TOBY
Toby Ziegler. 

JOEY
Hello. 

C.J.
C.J. Cregg. 

JOEY
Hi. I know who you all are. 

JOSH
I was just telling her about Kiefer's numbers. 

JOEY [KENNY]
I've seen those numbers. We shared the California polling data. 

TOBY
And? 

JOEY [KENNY]
Kiefer asked the wrong questions. His polls said that 80% of the people, when asked 
if they'd support an amendment prohibiting flag burning said yes, which is roughly 
the same amount of people that say they support sending litterbugs to prison. He never 
asked them how much they care. 

TOBY
Please, please say that you did. 

JOEY [KENNY]
How good am I looking to you right now? 

TOBY
That depends on the California numbers. 

JOEY [KENNY]
37%, or less than half of those who said they'd favor the amendment, rated the issue 
fairly or very important. 12%, or less than a third of that group, said that the issue 
would swing their vote. The only place that this war is being fought is in Washington. 

TOBY
You're looking very good to me right now. 

JOEY [KENNY]
I thought so. 

TOBY
Good to meet you. [gets up, and is followed by C.J. and Sam.] 

C.J.
Nice meeting you. 

JOSH 
[to Joey] Do you have any idea how big you scored with Toby and Sam right now? 

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes. Still. I think if you're going to have the President stand up and say something 
about flag burning, I think he should say that people shouldn't do it. I think he 
should say that it's a form of protest that a lot of people find terribly troubling. 

JOSH
Your polls say that? 

JOEY [KENNY]
I said that. So do a lot of people. "Vox populi, Vox dei." 

JOSH
"The voice of the people is the voice of a dog"? 

JOEY
The voice of God, Joshua! 

JOSH
God! Yes. 

JOEY [KENNY] 
[beat] I came here with someone. 

JOSH
I'm... I'm sorry? 

JOEY [KENNY]
I came here with someone. 

JOSH
Okay, um. I should go. I have to go. 

JOEY [KENNY]
Wait, will you call me some time, next time you come out here? 

JOSH
Absolutely. I will call in advance of my coming. 

JOEY
It was really good to see you. 

JOSH
You, too.

CUT TO: INT. A DARK STUDY ROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet and Ted Marcus are talking in a study room in the mansion. 

MARCUS
Mr. President, I don't need to tell you that I've got a large microphone at my disposal, 
and I'm going to demand that you publicly announce that you're going to veto Cameron's 
bill if it passes. 

BARTLET
It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on. 

MARCUS
No, I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol. 

BARTLET
And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted, and you're 
going to be Cameron's best friend. 

MARCUS
The people in my house want this. And they're complaining to me that you take their 
money and run, without listening. 

BARTLET
Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you, and I'll call 
them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that. 

MARCUS
Well, then why won't you... 

BARTLET
Ted. 

MARCUS
Why won't you say that publicly? 

BARTLET 
[yells] Because I know what I'm doing, Ted! Because I live in the world of professional 
politics, and you live in the world of adolescent tantrum! [beat] Don't you ever slap 
Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He's not 
one of your associate producers. 

MARCUS
You're right. 

BARTLET
Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood. 

MARCUS
I mean it. You're right. 

BARTLET
Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to gay rights 
in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is happens 
the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun, Ted. You got 
to trust me! I know what I'm doing. 

MARCUS
I trust you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Do you? 

MARCUS
Yes, I do. And I like you, too. 

BARTLET
Thank you. 

MARCUS
Have you enjoyed yourself tonight? 

BARTLET
No. 

MARCUS
Me, neither. If you don't mind my saying so, Mr. President, you look more tired than 
you did when I saw you a couple of months ago. 

BARTLET
Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from now. 
[beat] I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we flew out. 
You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the way back. 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The fundraiser is over. Josh is packing, while Donna is lying on the bed. 

DONNA
That was it? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

DONNA
Just because she said she was with somebody? 

JOSH
She said she was with somebody. 

DONNA
Oh, Josh! 

JOSH
Donna, she's with somebody! 

DONNA
She could have just been saying that. 

JOSH
Why would she just be saying that? 

DONNA
For the allure. 

JOSH
Oh. 

DONNA
Go see her before we leave. 

JOSH
It's one in the morning. 

DONNA
Go knock on her door. 

JOSH
I'm not going to knock on her door at one in the morning. 

DONNA
Yes! Because you're whisking away to Washington, and you had to see her one more time 
before you left, because God knows what fate awaits you when once you get there. 

JOSH
Are you okay? 

DONNA
Gather ye rosebuds, Josh. 

JOSH
Donna, I am not going to knock on her door

Donna starts clucking like a chicken.

JOSH
Were you just clucking like a chicken, is that what that was?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I couldn't knock on her door if I wanted to, I don't have her room number.

DONNA 
[picks up phone message] Yes, you do. 

She waves the message, and in a sing-song voice--

DONNA
Phone Message! Phone message!

JOSH
Okay, first of all, don't do that thing anymore with the phone message! Phone message!

DONNA
And?

JOSH
Tell them I'll be down in one minute. Wait, how's she going to know I'm knocking on 
the door?

DONNA
There's a button outside, a light flashes.

JOSH
[opening door] Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - OUTSIDE JOEY’S DOOR - NIGHT
Josh arrives at the door and pushes the button repeatedly. The door is finally opened 
by... Al Kiefer, dressed in a white robe.

AL
Josh.

JOSH
Al!

AL
What can I do for you?

JOSH
You know I got the wrong room.

AL
I don't think so. You're looking for Joey?

JOSH
Yeah.

AL
She's right here.

JOSH
No! I'm not. I-I-I was just stopping to say a quick goodbye, don't bother.

JOEY [OS]
Who's out there? 

She comes out of the bathroom, also dressed in a white robe. She is clearly shocked 
to see Josh at the door.

JOSH
I wanted to say a quick goodbye. We’re taking off. And, uh, thank you for talking to 
us tonight. That was helpful.

Joey signs something at him.

AL
She said goodbye.

JOSH
I know. 

Joeey gives him a really sweet smile.

JOSH
Goodbye.

Josh walks away as Al closes the door.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Everyone in the plane is asleep, except Bartlet. He’s inside his office, 
talking on the phone to Vice President Hoynes.

BARTLET 
[into phone] Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it to rest.

HOYNES [VO]
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
You're welcome. Bye.

HOYNES [VO]
Good night.

BARTLET
Wait. John?

HOYNES [VO]
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung 
in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things 
you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going 
to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to 
say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who 
knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John.

HOYNES [VO]
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'm going to try to go to sleep now.

HOYNES [VO]
Good night, Mr. President. See you in the morning.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Bartlet slowly hangs up phone and closes his eyes. As the camera closes in, his eyes 
slowly, and sadly, open again.

DISSOLVE TO: END CREDITS.
FADE TO BLACK.

West Wing S01E17
The President's (Martin Sheen) and First Lady's (Stockard Channing) staffs feud over rival agendas when her public statements about foreign child-labor abuse inspires a Congresswoman Becky Reeseman (Amy Aquino) to attach an amendment that will surely torpedo a long-delayed international tariff bill favored by the President. What's more, when the revered chairman of the Federal Reserve dies, the President is under pressure to name the former head's top lieutenant as his successor -- the same man who seriously dated the First Lady in college. Away from the White House, Zoey (Elisabeth Moss) clashes with her boyfriend Charlie (Dul� Hill) when she suggests that they not step out together at an upcoming club opening at the request of the Secret Service which is concerned about recent hate letters concerning their interracial relationship. Josh (Bradley Whitford) asks opinionated Toby (Richard Schiff) to mind his manners prior to parleying with important Congressmen.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. MURAL ROOM - DAY
Abbey sits in front of cameras with JEFFREY MORGAN. Several members of her staff 
and Jeffrey's parents sit behind the camera. Production staff adjust lights and 
apply makeup. 

ABBEY
I don't want you to be nervous. 

JEFFREY
Okay. 

ABBEY
If you're nervous I'll detect it and mock you mercilessly on national television. 

JEFFREY
Okay. 

ABBEY
Sure, some people think it's cool for the First Lady to mock a 14 year old boy 
who's only crime is getting nervous, talking on television in front of millions 
and millions of people, but hey, I'm gonna do it anyway. 

JEFFREY
[nods] Okay, I understand. 

ABBEY
Jeffery... 

JEFFREY
Yes, Ma'am? 

ABBEY
I was kidding. [Jeffrey laughs.] Now, if you do get nervous, just look at me or 
look at your parents. 

JEFFREY
Okay. 

ABBEY
But you're not gonna get nervous, are you? 

JEFFREY
[shakes head] Nope. 

ABBEY
[smiles] If you do I'll beat your brains out. 

JEFFREY
[smiles] Yes, Ma'am. 

ABBEY
[smiles] Not me personally 'cause I have people who do that for me. But you get 
the idea. 

DIRECTOR
Mrs. Bartlet, ten seconds. 

ABBEY
[loudly] Lilly, should have worn gray today! 

LILLY
You're good. 

Abbey shakes off tension and faces the camera. 

HOST [on TV]
Twenty-five minutes past the hour and 42 degrees outside our Rockefeller Center 
studios. Abigail Bartlet is no stranger to the fight for children's health around 
the world. And she's taken the time to speak with us this morning. Good morning, 
Mrs. Bartlet. 

ABBEY
Good Morning, Melissa. 

HOST [on TV]
You're speaking to us from the Mural Room, is that right? 

ABBEY
That's right. [looks at Jeffery] And I'm here to introduce this young man on 
my left, Jeffery Morgan. Jeffery helped opened my eyes to the issue of child 
labor exploitation around the world. 

Abbey's chief of staff, LILLY MAYS, watches for a moment and walks out to the HALLWAY.

HOST [on TV]
Now Jeffery, you started your organization because of pen pal you felt was in trouble. 

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATION'S BULLPEN - DAY
Sam stands watching the program on a monitor. Lilly walks up to him. 

JEFFREY [on TV]
Yes, and I thought that... 

SAM
[confused] When did Jeffery happen? 

LILLY
Sam... 

SAM
Lilly, when did Jeffery happen? 

LILLY
I dug it up for her yesterday. You're gonna love him. 

SAM
Let's find out. 

They watch the monitor. 

HOST [on TV]
Your organization, the Kids Crusade... 

JEFFREY [on TV]
The Children's Crusade. 

HOST [ON TV]
The Children...I'm sorry. The Children's Crusade was created when your pen 
pal was sold into slavery, is that right? 

JEFFREY [on TV]
Well, that's not they call it in India, but that's what it is. You see, Panshant's 
mother borrowed $25. And Panshant had to go to work to pay back the loan. 

LILLY
He's good. 

SAM
Yeah. 

ABBEY [on TV]
She borrowed the money from what we would call a loan shark, Melissa. Then Panshant 
was bonded to work for the loan shark. But he never paid back the loan because he... 

SAM looks at a newspaper. 

LILLY
And here's my thing. 

SAM
What? 

LILLY
What would you guys think about the President not going to the Hill to the Budget 
Meeting but bringing the leadership to the White House instead? 

SAM
Why? 

LILLY
We want the news cycle. 

SAM
[looks up from the paper] Lilly? 

LILLY
She's got the National Press Club tomorrow. It's her first major speech since 
Commencement Season. It's child labor and we want the news cycle. 

SAM
[reads the paper] News cycle doesn't belong to us, Lilly. It's not ours to give away. 

LILLY
You know what I'm talking about. 

SAM
We want to show that the President is reaching out to Congress for a Budget 
compromise. He's literally going to Congress. 

LILLY
He's being driven 6 blocks in a stretch limo, Sam. It's not like he's Henry Clay. 

SAM
It's a symbol. 

LILLY
Your guy steps out of a motorcade and it's three column inches above the fold. My guy 
is page 23. 

SAM
Your guy's married to our guy and our guy won an election. That's something you people 
are gonna have to get used to. 

LILLY
Your guy has a 48% approval rating. My guy's at 61. And bite me. 

SAM
Ah, point well argued. [goes back to reading the paper] 

HOST [on TV]
Mrs. Bartlet, does the company know its subcontractors are using child labor? 

ABBEY [on TV]
Melissa, if they don't then they're criminally negligent. If they do then they're 
simply criminal. 

LILLY
[pointing at the TV] There it is! 

SAM
That was a pretty good pitch to inning. 

LILLY
Come on Sam, see Toby. Give us some room to run! 

SAM
Lilly... 

TOBY
[walks out of his office] Change the channel. 

LILLY
Toby... 

TOBY
[to Lilly] Hi. [to Sam] Change to Channel 5. 

SAM
What happened? 

TOBY
Bernie Dahl died. 

Toby walks back in his office. They stare at him for a moment. 

ABBEY [on TV]
Eighty hours a week in darkness and violence.... 

Sam grabs the remote and changes channels. 

REPORTER [on TV]
...suffering what is being described as a massive heart attack was pronounced dead 
upon arrival at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Mr. Dahl, widely respected on Wall 
Street as the chief architect of the longest peacetime economic expansion in history, 
was in a fourth year of his second four year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. 

SAM
You just lost your news cycle.

ACT ONE 

FADE IN: INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet sits with two Intelligence advisors. 

BARTLET
[reading] Is here going to be a coup? 

ADVISOR
Excuse me, sir? 

BARTLET
Is there going to be a coup? 

MILITARY ADVISOR
Uh, no sir. We believe the new few weeks the Abida Kahn will appoint their successors 
from diverse regions and groups, including the Ebo from the East. 

Leo wanders in and stands in the doorway. 

ADVISOR
They've been complainting of under representation. 

BARTLET
And this is on page.... 

ADVISOR
17... In your classified book. 

BARTLET
Page 17. 

They page through. 

LEO
Excuse me... Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Yeah? [looks up] Oh. [to advisors] Excuse me, please. [gets up and walks over to Leo] 
Leo... Intelligence briefing. 

LEO
I know. 

BARTLET
There are mornings I'm just nodding my head. That can't be good for anybody. 

LEO
Bernie Dahl had a heart attack. 

BARTLET
No! 

LEO
Yeah. He died about an hour ago... 

BARTLET
[shocked] He died?!? 

LEO
...on the way to the hospital. Bad timing. 

BARTLET
I'll say. Who knows so far? 

LEO
We got it off the news. 

BARTLET
Dammit. 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
[looks at his watch] The market is going to open 200 points down. 

LEO
If we're lucky. 

BARTLET
When was the last time we were lucky? 

LEO
Super Tuesday. 

BARTLET
It's going to be 300...350. 

LEO
Announce Ron Ehrlich. 

BARTLET
Not yet. 

LEO
Announce Ron Ehrlich as Dahl's successor. 

BARTLET
Not... yet. 

LEO
You do it this morning when trading opens everyone calms down. 

BARTLET
I'm not saying I'm not sure it's Ehrlich. 

LEO
Sir... 

BARTLET
I'm saying I'm not sure. It's the Fed Chairman. Give me a day. 

LEO
It's gonna be an expensive day. 

BARTLET
How expensive. 

LEO
You say 300 points. It could be more. 

BARTLET
Wall Street needs to trust me. 

LEO
Should I go tell them that?

BARTLET
A day. I'll tell you something else. You could have been nicer to me during this 
conversation. 

LEO
How? 

BARTLET
By saying that Wall Street does trust me and the market will hold until I appoint 
a new Fed Chairman. 

LEO
Sure. Just give me a minute to call my broker and dump my portfolio. 

BARTLET
I'm taking the day. 

LEO
I'm going to leak it, sir, on account in the next hour people will calm things down. 

BARTLET
No. 

LEO
Mr. President! 

BARTLET
I'm not ready to jump into bed with Ron Ehrlich yet. I'm one of the few people in my 
family who can say that. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

The advisors stand as Bartlet walks back over to them. 

BARTLET 
So... [sits] That's was page 17? 

The advisors sit. 

ADVISOR
Yes, sir. The Leader of the National Assembly... 

CUT TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh leans back in his chair, phone to his ear. Donna walks in. 

DONNA
So, I've been reading this book. 

JOSH
I'm...on the phone.

DONNA
You're on hold! 

JOSH
How do you know? 

DONNA
The light was blinking. 

JOSH
[glares at the blinking light] What book? 

DONNA
It's about what life was like 100 years ago. 

JOSH
Donna, the fact that I'm on hold right now this shouldn't be your cue to tell 
me what like was like 100 years ago. 

DONNA
For instance... [Josh sighs.] A hundred years ago most women bathed once a 
month and they used borax or egg yolks for shampoo. 

JOSH [into phone]
[sits up quickly] I'm here. [turns his head away from Donna]

DONNA
Florence and Bertha were among the top ten names given girls. 

JOSH [into phone] 
I'm meeting with them in 5mintues. Toby's gonna be fine. 

DONNA
Today they don't make the top ten thousand. 

JOSH [into phone]
Excuse me. [to Donna] What?? [holds the phone against his forehead]

DONNA
Florence and Bertha aren't among the top ten thousands names today yet only a .... 

JOSH
I'm actually back on the phone now. 

DONNA
I'll wait. [sits on the arm of a chair]

JOSH [into phone]
Toby's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it. [hangs up and puts on his suit coat] 
Toby's in his office? 

DONNA
Yeah. Population of Las Vegas, Nevada... [Josh stares at her.] ...was 22. 

JOSH
I'm gonna go to my meeting now. But you sit here and keeping talking. It'll be like 
I never left. [grabs papers and walks around his desk]

DONNA
Here. [stands up and hands him a folder]

JOSH
Thank you. 

Josh walks out with Donna in pursuit. They wander through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

DONNA
And you know what else? 

JOSH
What? 

DONNA
Drive-by shootings were a problem in Denver. 

JOSH
100 years ago? 

DONNA
Yeah! 

JOSH
What were they driving? 

DONNA
I'm glad you asked. 

JOSH
Horses! 

DONNA
Young boys on horseback riding through town shooting at, I suppose...stagecoaches 
and whatnot. 

JOSH
[drops off mail] When do you have time to read these books?!? 

DONNA
It's important to make time just for yourself, Josh. 

JOSH
I notice you're able to do it right here at the office. 

DONNA
I'm adaptable. 

JOSH
Among other things. 

Donna smiles as Josh walks off. 

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Sam paces outside Toby's door. Toby sits inside writing on a pad and munching antacids. 

TOBY
Sam? 

SAM
Yeah? [walks in]

TOBY
C.J. gonna need a reason why the President's waiting a day that doesn't sound like 
we're reconsidering Ehrlich. 

SAM
I just gave her one. 

TOBY
What? 

SAM
Respect. 

TOBY
[sighs] The man just died... out of respect for his memory... his family... 

SAM
It would be wrong to name a successor on the day he... 

TOBY
Respect works.

SAM
[sighs] Tell you this though, I'm going to the gym today. [paces]

TOBY
Okay that didn't seem to be about anything that interests me. 

SAM
I'm just saying. Bernie Dahl has a heart attack, BAM!.... right out of nowhere. 

TOBY
It's his fifth heart attack Sam. He was 138 years old. [munches antacids]

SAM
Yeah but these are highly stressful jobs. I haven't been to the gym in three weeks. 

TOBY
Sam, look at yourself. How much healthier do you want to be? 

SAM
I'm just saying if anybody need me at lunch I'm gonna be at the gym. And that's 
gonna be sad for me because I'm gonna live longer than you. 

TOBY
Don't count on it. 

Sam leaves. Josh runs up. 

SAM
[gloomy] Hey. 

JOSH
Hey. [steps in] Toby.... 

TOBY
We are waiting a day to make our announcement out of respect, Josh. 

JOSH
For whom? 

TOBY
The dead. 

JOSH
Oh. 

TOBY
And how I wish I were one of them. 

JOSH
Now...You're gonna love this meeting! 

TOBY
Betcha I'm not. 

JOSH
Toby.... 

TOBY
It's locked down. 

JOSH
I know that! 

TOBY
[loudly] It's locked down with some 15 votes to spare. 

JOSH
There is value for having these three Congressmen on board. 

TOBY
What is it? 

JOSH
A... A clear and public demonstration that the President's liberal base hasn't 
turned their backs. 

Toby gets up and walks behind his desk. 

TOBY
[smiles] In the case of these three people, I'd like to see a clear and public 
demonstration that they've turned their backs and run as far as humanly possible. 

JOSH
I think you think it's beneath you to ask. 

TOBY
[yelling] It is beneath me to ask. It's sown up! By 15. [Josh looks around nervously.] 
[yelling] We've got the trade bill. It's sewn up! And it's as bipartisan as we're 
likely to see. There was a victory and we're the victors. And I'm not going in there 
hat in my hands. 

JOSH
No one's asking you too. 

TOBY
[yelling] You're asking me too! 

Josh walks in and closes the door. 

JOSH
No, we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. 

TOBY
No...we're really not.

JOSH
Why not? 

TOBY
Cause this isn't an episode of Hawaii 5-0. How about you be the good cop, I'll 
be the cop who didn't go to the meeting. 

JOSH
You have to go to the meeting. I told them you would be at the meeting. If you're 
not there they're gonna start right out insulted. 

Josh heads to the door and opens it for Toby. 

TOBY
I go to this meeting there's a decent chance we end this meeting with them insulted. 
So... [grabs the antacids]

JOSH
Let's go. 

Josh opens the door for Toby. They exit into the COMUNICATION'S OFFICE.

TOBY
I need to exercise more. 

JOSH
Toby... 

TOBY
I gotta exercise more. I gotta eat better. 

Toby munches antacids. They pause in the doorway. 

JOSH
Toby, you're gonna sit in that room and you're gonna behave yourself. I swear 
to God, you are gonna sit there while I court these peoples votes and every 
so often you're gonna smile so as to indicate warmth. 

TOBY
I can still kick the crap outta you, though. We're clear on that, right? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

TOBY
Then what the heck are we waiting for? 

Josh eyes Toby warily. Toby munches the antacids. 

JOSH
Toby... 

TOBY
I'll be nice. 

JOSH
The President's very serious about this. 

TOBY
He shouldn't be. 

JOSH
So you've told him many times but here these people are. So, I guess the President 
disagrees with you... Given that... 

TOBY
I understand. Let's go. 

JOSH sticks out his chin and glares at Toby. They exit into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
So you're just gonna sit there. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

JOSH
If you open your mouth it will be to say something nice. 

TOBY
Yes. 

Josh looks doubtful. 

JOSH 
Come on. 

Josh pauses at the door and eyes Toby before they enter THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. 

TOBY
[whispers] It's sewn up, Josh. 

JOSH
[whispers] Whatever. 

TOBY
[whispers] By 15 votes. 

JOSH
Morning. 

CONGRESSMAN 1
Morning. 

JOSH
How are you? 

Josh walks over and shakes the hands of the Congressmen. 

CONGRESSMAN 1
Good. 

JOSH
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming. 

CONGRESSMAN 2
Josh, how are you? 

Toby sits sullenly at the table, munching antacids. 

JOSH
How you been? 

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is at the podium. 

C.J.
He is shocked and saddened by the death of his colleague. For over 11 years 
Bernard Dahl oversaw the largest economic expansion in the country's history 
and I can assure you he will be....

[shouting] C.J.! C.J.! 

C.J.
...missed. [sighs] Katie?

KATIE
Is Ron Ehrlich the new Fed Chair? 

C.J.
There are a number of very good candidates.

CHRIS
Who's on the short list? 

C.J.
I want to be clear, no such list exists. Obviously from his post as the number 
two man at the Federal Reserve, Ron Ehrlich is a candidate.

STEVE
Sidney Bloom? 

C.J.
Sidney Bloom is a candidate. 

STEVE
Lawrence Ottenberg? 

C.J.
Mr. Ottenberg is a candidate. 

DANNY
C.J., Mrs. Bartlet's declared a preference for Ron Ehrlich. To what extent do 
you think that's going to weigh in on the President's decision? 

C.J.
[looks caught off-guard] I'm aware of no such declaration. 

DANNY
It's in a wire piece. 'Unnamed people close the First Lady' are saying she hoped 
the President would appoint Ron Ehrlich when Bernie Dahl's term expired. 

C.J.
I don't know who the unnamed people are. But I suppose it's possible on a social 
occasion... 

DANNY
OK.

KATIE
C.J., when's the President going to name the new Chairman? 

C.J.
We're hoping to have it done tomorrow. 

CHRIS
Why the delay? 

C.J.
[solemnly] Respect. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Carol exit the Briefing Room. 

C.J.
Get me a copy of the wire report? 

CAROL
On your desk. 

C.J.
Could I have sounded any stupider saying respect? 

CAROL
You were fine! 

Sam approaches from the other direction with his gym bag. 

C.J.
Sam. 

SAM
Yeah? 

C.J.
I need you. 

SAM
I'm going to the gym. 

C.J. turns and walks back with him. 

C.J.
I got a question about Mrs. Bartlet stating her preference for Ron Ehrlich. 

They stop walking in the lobby doorway. 

SAM
Publically? 

C.J.
It's in a wire piece that's on my desk. 

Ginger walks by. 

SAM
Ginger! [throws his gym bag to her]

GINGER
Back to your office? 

SAM
Yep! 

Ginger walks off with the bag. 

C.J.
Thank you! 

C.J. pats him on the arm. They head off in different directions. 

CUT TO: INT. LILLY'S OFFICE - DAY
Lilly is on the phone. A staffer sits across the desk. 

LILLY [into phone]
She was fantastic this morning and I can promise you that was just the opening 
salvo. First Lady is gonna lead the charge against Child Labor. [whispers to 
staffer] There's some index cards on Patty's desk . I need them for the ride over. 

The staffer gets up and leaves as Sam enters. 

SAM
Hi.

STAFFER
Hi. 

LILLY [into phone]
Yeah, she'll do Larry King tonight then go to St Louis. Yeah, call me back later 
and I'll give you 10 minutes. [hangs up.] Did you see the rest of the interview? 

She stands and shuffles through papers. 

SAM
I didn't. 

LILLY
Jeffery and his classmates raised enough money for Panshant and everyone in their 
village to get out of debt. 

SAM
Well that solves that, then. 

LILLY
Abbey's running with the ball, Sam. 

SAM
And I just want to make sure we're the ones calling the plays in the huddle, Lilly. 

LILLY
What's the problem? 

SAM
C.J. got a question regarding the First Lady's preference for Ron Ehrlich. 

LILLY
Her preference is fairly well known, Sam. I don't think... 

SAM
This time it was in a wire piece...'Sources close to Mrs. Bartlet'. 

LILLY
I don't know anything about it. 

SAM
It wasn't you... 

LILLY
I just said I didn't know anything about it. 

SAM
Okay, we'll let you know when we want something leaked. You know that, right? 

LILLY
[angry] Sam, I standing here telling you and I'm telling you that I don't know 
anything about it. And if C.J. wants to come up here and call me a liar... 

SAM
C.J. didn't come up here, I did. No one's calling you a liar. 

Lilly puts down the papers and buttons her suitcoat. 

LILLY
We've gotta find a way for our two staffs to work together better than this. 

SAM
No we don't. We need to find a way for your staff to work better with our staff. 

LILLY
Well, that's the spirit, Sam. 

SAM
Look, I'm... 

LILLY
[coldly] I'm late for a speech. [walks out angrily]

SAM
Lilly? 

The Staffer rushes back in and looks through some folders on a table. 

SAM
[quietly] That was a nice bit of diplomacy I... just did there. [The staffer looks at 
him.] That's good. [to staffer] I'm going to the gym now. 

STAFFER
Okay! [leaves]

SAM
Okay. 

Sam shakes his head and walks out, hands on pockets. 

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO 

FADE IN: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet stands behind his desk talking to Leo. C.J. stares at them. 

BARTLET
Without regard to the validity of past arguments. 

LEO
That the National Debt was so high it required us to suck up to the bond market. 

BARTLET
Yes and I'm saying that condition doesn't exist anymore.

LEO
Well, maybe so. 

BARTLET
Historically, American prosperity has been built the broad growth in the GDP 
of 5% of greater. And now with the deflationary pressures of the Global Economy, 
that kind of growth can be achieved without the negative side affects of rampant 
inflation. [to C.J.] Do you understand what I'm saying?

C.J. starts to open her mouth. 

LEO
C.J. doesn't understand a word you're saying. 

C.J.
I understand the [something French]. I get the basic [more French] of what you're saying. 
[Leo and Bartlet smile at each other.] I really don't understand anything. 

BARTLET
My point is Ron Ehrlich might not be the guy. I'm saying it's not a mortal lock. 

C.J.
So let me suggest, Mr. President, that I talk to the First Lady and ask her to clarify... 

BARTLET
[shakes head] No... 

C.J.
...that her position... 

BARTLET
No, no... 

C.J.
"My husband will choose the best man for the Fed...." 

BARTLET
[shakes head] Noooo... 

C.J.
..." I support whatever..." Sir! 

BARTLET
C.J., we don't handle my wife. When we try, do you know what happens at the other 
end of this building? [smiles] 

C.J.
You get a little punishment. 

BARTLET
I get a little punishment. Screw it. Let's move on. It's not a big deal. 
[walks behind his desk]

C.J.
Yes, sir. 

Leo looks at C.J. 

BARTLET
[to C.J.] But try to find out who those friends of my wife's are in the wire piece 
and take them out back and have them shot. [to Leo] Can I do that? 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Yeah, Leo says I can do that. It's gonna be Phyllis who has never liked me. 
It's gonna be Susan who thinks I'm xenophobic because I don't like Mexican food. 
These are my wife's friends. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[walks in] Mr. President... 

BARTLET
Yes. [to Leo and C.J.] It could be our old next-door neighbors Herb and Marjorie 
Douglas. [Mrs. Landingham frowns at him.] They're still angry at me 'cause 
I accidentally ran them over with my car. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Zoey's here. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. 

Mrs. Landingham leaves the door open as she exits. 

C.J.
Anything else? 

BARTLET
No. 

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Thank you, C.J. 

C.J. leaves. 

BARTLET
I'll tell you what else; historically 2 to 2 ½ GDP expansion is classified 
lack luster even anemic economic growth. [walks towards the open door]
Four ½ to 5% is needed just to be considered robust and not even spectacular. 

LEO
[confused] You know, sometimes I don't know what you're talking about. 

BARTLET
Sometimes I'm just making it up. 

Zoey steps in. 

BARTLET
Hello, sweetheart. 

ZOEY
Dad. 

BARTLET 
[kisses Zoey on the cheek.] You used to go to school in overalls with a little hat. 
[closes the door]

ZOEY
Yes, I used to be five. 

LEO
What's up, Zoey? 

ZOEY
Just keeping it real. 

LEO
[confused] Hmm? 

BARTLET
Who the hell knows? [gives her a hug] 

LEO
Anything else? 

BARTLET
No.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Leo. 

Leo walks out to his office.

BARTLET
What you got today? 

ZOEY
I got Intro to Cinema and 19th Century Studies. 

BARTLET
How about math. Why aren't you taking math? 

ZOEY
Cause I graduated High School. 

Zoey and Bartlet sit on the couch. 

BARTLET
Wiseass all you want, but you're coming of age in the 21st century. A century 
in which I promise you mathematics is going to play a starring role. On the 
other hand I would definitely put my shoulder into Intro to Cinema. Intro to 
Cinema's what got me where I am today. 

ZOEY
Did you call me over to make fun of me? 

BARTLET
That was going to be a big part of my day. [gives her the books back]

ZOEY
Dad...

BARTLET
I met with Butterfield and some Secret Service Agents this morning. 

ZOEY
What did I do? 

BARTLET
You didn't do anything. They think you should be taking more math. 

ZOEY
[laughs] Dad...

BARTLET
It's time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting. 

ZOEY
[worried] Threats? 

BARTLET
[frowns] Yeah. They don't like that the daughter of the President is dating a young 
black man. 

ZOEY
Charlie? 

BARTLET
Zoey, please don't tell me you're dating more than one guy. 

ZOEY
[concerned] No. 

BARTLET
Ok. 

ZOEY
What is... 

BARTLET
Cause one guy for you is actually one more than I'm comfortable with.

ZOEY
So you've said. 

BARTLET
I could see it's had a real impact on you. 

ZOEY
How bad are the letters? 

BARTLET
No worse than any of the stuff they intercept. 

ZOEY
Except these are from White Supremists? 

BARTLET
Yeah. Why did Butterfield and the guys meet with me? Apparently there's National 
Convention of some sort in Virginia. It was in the papers yesterday that you 
and Charlie are going to some club opening this weekend. 

ZOEY
You want me to cancel? 

BARTLET
You don't have to cancel, but you can't bring Charlie. 

ZOEY
[frowns] Okay. 

BARTLET
You want me to tell him? 

ZOEY
[looks down] We're meeting for lunch. I'll tell him. 

BARTLET
You gotta tell him he truth Zoey. Don't make something up. 

ZOEY
[laughs] He's not gonna like it. 

BARTLET
You sure you don't want me to come? 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

Mrs. Landingham knocks and enters. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President... 

BARTLET
Yeah?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The Assistant Secretary of Treasury. 

BARTLET
Okay. [to Zoey] You gotta go. 

Zoey and Bartlet rise. 

ZOEY
Hey, I'm sorry about Bernie Dahl. 

BARTLET
I never really new him that well. 

They walk to the door. 

ZOEY
Is Ron Ehrlich gonna be the new Fed Chair? 

BARTLET
I don't know. You want the job? 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Can't have it. Know why? 

ZOEY
Why? 

BARTLET
Not enough math. Bye. 

He kisses her on the cheek and she leaves. 

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Josh and Toby sits across the table from the congressmen and their aides. Toby slowly 
dunks a teabag and looks bored. 

CONGRESSMAN
Josh, we're Democrats. Since when do we like lower taxes? 

JOSH
We don't. We like lower tariffs. Lower tariffs on everything from Indian textiles, 
to German cars to Chilean wines negotiated by our trade reps in Geneva with 
130 other countries over the past 7 years. Global Free Trade Markets Access 
Act now has cleared the President and we're very proud it's finally ready to 
be voted on by the House. 

TOBY
[stares at the teabag] Where it will win by the way by some 15 votes. 

JOSH
[patiently] Thank you, Toby. 

TOBY
Anyone eating that donut? 

JOSH
[pause, to Toby] All yours. [To the Congressmen] Now, what happens when you lower the 
cost of something, Economists of every stripe, including the one in the Oval Office, 
say you that you get a more efficient allotment of economic resources. Now that may 
not sound like much to you and me but to an Economist that's a week in St. Barts.

CONGRESSWOMAN
Josh, there's no reason to talk to us like were 12. 

CONGRESSMAN 1
Josh, we're very concerned about the effect cheaper goods flowing into this 
country will have on American Labor and American Manufacturing. We're concerned 
about the lack of environmental controls. 

CONGRESSMAN 2
Concerns which are entirely reasonable. 

TOBY
You're concerned about American labor and manufacturing?

CONGRESSMAN 1
Yeah. 

TOBY
What kind of car do you drive? 

CONGRESSMAN 1
Toyota. 

TOBY
Then shut up. 

Josh frowns and covers his face. The congressmen stare in shock at Toby. 

CONGRESSMAN 1
Excuse me? 

Josh rubs his eyes. Toby calmly drinks his tea. 

JOSH
What Toby meant to say is we don't get to see you guys often...[smiles] and it's a 
crying shame. 

C.J. knocks on the window. Josh looks over his shoulder at her. He turns back to the 
Congressmen. 

JOSH
[smiles] Hey everybody, sit tight. We're just getting started. [gets up and heads for 
the door] Uh, think about what you'd like to eat for lunch. 

TOBY
[slowly gets up, smiles] Also think about that we won and we're here still courting 
your vote for reasons passing understanding. 

Josh walks back and takes him by the arm. 

JOSH
Get out here. 

They exit into the HALLWAY. C.J. waits as Josh backs out the door. Toby follows. 

JOSH
This... right here. This is why you have a reputation as a pain in the ass. 

TOBY
I've cultivated that reputation. 

JOSH
Could I get you to try harder in there? 

C.J. stares at them. 

TOBY
Sure, cause right now I'm not trying at all. 

C.J.
Guys, I'm standing here. I don't know if you've.... 

JOSH
Yeah? 

C.J.
The wire has a piece. It'll be picked up. 'Sources close to the First Lady say that 
she'... 

TOBY
Ron Ehrlich? 

C.J.
Yeah. 

JOSH
Who are the sources? 

C.J.
I don't know. Sam spoke to Lilly. She doesn't know a thing about it. 

JOSH
Is it Lilly? 

C.J.
Yeah. 

Josh snickers. 

TOBY
Mrs. Bartlet should slide in and step in the back door. 'Ron Ehrlich is an old 
friend but she supports whatever'... 

C.J.
Yeah. She's not going to unless someone tells her to. 

TOBY
[loudly] Well, that sounds an awful lot like your job, C.J. 

C.J.
Well, I was just in there and he doesn't want me to handle the First Lady. 

JOSH
Did he say he didn't want you to 'handle the First lady cause he didn't want you to' 
or did he say it like 'handle the First Lady but I'm not the one who told you to?' 

C.J.
That's what I don't know. 

JOSH
You gotta learn the signs. 

C.J.
I've got most of the signs. 

JOSH
You don't have that one! 

C.J.
I'm learning that one. 

TOBY
Where's Sam? 

C.J.
He went to the gym. 

TOBY
Page Sam and tell him I want him to talk to Lilly again. 

C.J.
What if the President meant it? 

TOBY
[sighs] We're not handling Mrs. Bartlet. We're talking to her staff. Page Sam. 

C.J.
I know most of the signs. 

TOBY
Go! 

C.J. walks off. 

JOSH
So what would you have done if the guy told you he drove and American car?

TOBY
Find some other way of humiliating him. 

JOSH
You like winning, don't you? 

TOBY
Saves you from having to say the word please. 

JOSH
Let's go. [walks back in]

TOBY
Absolutely. [follows]

CUT TO: INT. GYM - DAY
Sam is lifting weights as his pager goes off. He seats the weights and sits up, 
banging his head on the bar. 

SAM
Ow! 

As he picks up his pager, Congresswoman BECKY REESEMAN walks over. 

REESEMAN
You Alright? 

SAM
Ah, Congresswoman...yes. I'm fine, thanks. 

REESEMAN
I heard the clang and the ow. I figured it must be Sam Seaborn. 

SAM
I'm just trying to get healthy. 

REESEMAN
How's your head? 

SAM
I'm fine. 

REESEMAN
Listen, I actually came over here for a different reason. 

SAM
[stands] How can I help you? 

REESEMAN
Um... Can I talk to you over there for a second? 

They walk over to a corner.

SAM
Congresswoman? 

REESEMAN
'Becky's' fine. 

SAM
[laughs] Okay.

REESEMAN
Where are you guys on the trade bill? 

SAM
Josh and Toby say we're 15 votes up. 

REESEMAN
Oh, yeah? 

SAM
Yeah, we're meeting with some friends of your right now to try to run up the score. 

REESEMAN
Uh, I want you to know I'm talking to you right now as a courtesy. 

SAM
Okay. 

REESEMAN
There's no obligation for me to come to you. 

SAM
Okay. 

REESEMAN
Any my coming to you and telling you is not an invitation to try to talk me out of it. 
So I... 

SAM
Becky, tell me you're not offering an amendment. 

REESEMAN
I am. 

SAM
Becky...

REESEMAN
Child Labor restrictions. 

SAM
You can't. 

REESEMAN
The First Lady blew the trumpet. 

SAM
She didn't...

REESEMAN
Sam, she did it on television. Given my record I can't be left out of it. 

SAM
You're not being left of anything. 

REESEMAN
Sam, I'm talking to you as a courtesy. 

SAM
This is why we fast tracked this to avoid this kind... 

REESEMAN
I'm talking to you... 

SAM
I understand.... 

REESEMAN
I'm talking to you as a courtesy... 

SAM
This is gonna blow the vote outta the water. Joshua and Toby have a hard nose count 
that puts us over... 

REESEMAN
I'm talking to you as a courtesy, Sam. I'm introducing the amendment tonight. Josh 
and Toby are just gonna have to count again. [looks at his forehead] You should put 
some ice on that head. 

She wanders off leaving. Sam looks frustrated. 

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE 

FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY
Danny Concannon is on the phone. Leo walks up.

DANNY
[into phone] ...Free Market Access Act. The GFTMAA. 

LEO
Danny? 

DANNY
Joanie, I'll call you back. 

LEO
You don't have to get off. 

DANNY
No problem. [hangs up] 

LEO
Take a walk with me. I'm on my way out. 

They walk through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

DANNY
Say Leo, I noticed the market opened 320 points down. 

LEO
We noticed that ourselves. 

DANNY
You see it's rebounding. 

LEO
Yes. 

DANNY
Not very fast. 

LEO
It'll be fine. 

DANNY
The President needs to name a new Fed Chair. 

LEO
We will. 

DANNY
I got a half year's salary in technology stocks is what I'm saying. 

LEO
I had a hunch. 

DANNY
What do you need? 

LEO
The President was wondering if you have a few minutes to spare at the end of the day. 

DANNY
[stops abruptly, confused] Yeah. 

LEO
[looks around for Danny and turns back] It'll just be you. It'll be informal and off 
the record. They'll be a reception at five for the Michigan Women's Democratic Caucus. 
He'll step out for a few minutes. 

Danny looks at Leo suspiciously. 

LEO
What? 

DANNY
Well it sounds like... 

LEO
Like the place will be lousy with female Democrats? 

DANNY
Yeah. 

LEO
Yeah. 

DANNY
Ok. 

LEO
Thanks. 

Leo leaves. Danny turns as spots C.J. entering the lobby. 

DANNY
Hey. 

C.J.
Hello, Daniel. 

DANNY
How you doing? 

C.J.
I don't have time to talk to you now. 

DANNY
Okay. 

Danny leaves. C.J. walks up to Sam as he enters the building with his gym bag. 

C.J.
Sam? 

SAM
Yeah? 

C.J.
I paged you. 

SAM
Yeah. I got your page and thanks. I hit my head. Becky Reeseman came over. I've got 
to talk to Josh and Toby.

C.J.
I need you for a second first. 

SAM
What is it? They stop. 

C.J.
I mentioned the wire piece to the President. 

SAM
What did he say? 

C.J.
He said he doesn't want the First Lady handled. 

SAM
Did he mean it or did he mean he wants you... 

C.J.
[sighs] I don't know. 

SAM
C.J.... 

C.J.
I don't have that sign. 

SAM
You gotta pick up the signs. 

C.J.
I've got most all of them. 

SAM
Yeah well, it's an important one to learn. 

C.J.
Toby thinks if you talk to Lilly Mays again... 

SAM
Clarification. 

C.J.
Staffer to Staffer. Gently nudge her in that direction. 

SAM
Yeah, all right. Where are Josh and Toby? 

C.J.
They're still in their meeting. 

SAM
[walks off] Gotta learn the signs, C.J.. 

C.J.
I know! [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
They're still sitting around that table.

CONGRESSMAN
Can you deny that the fact that you can buy a British made Range Rover has hurt Ford 
to some degree? 

JOSH
No, but.... 

TOBY
I can. 

JOSH
Toby... [sighs] 

TOBY
I can deny it. Range Rover inspired Ford to design the Explorer. Which is the best 
selling vehicle in its class and Ford's most successful model in years. 

Sam knocks on the door. 

JOSH
Will you excuse us for a moment? 

Josh and Toby get up to leave. 

CONGRESSMAN 2
Are we keeping you two from something more important? 

TOBY
Many... many things. 

The Congressmen look in surprise as they exit. Out in the HALLWAY, Sam waits outside 
as Josh backs out the door again. Toby follows. 

JOSH
I have to say if there's been improvement in your attitude, it's marginal. 

TOBY
We're in hour number four, you understand. 

SAM
Guys... 

JOSH
Yeah?

TOBY
I thought you were at the gym. 

SAM
I was. And then Becky Reeseman came over to talk to me. She made it very clear it was 
just a courtesy. 

JOSH
What'd she say? 

SAM
She's attaching... 

TOBY
No! 

SAM
She's attaching a Child Labor Amendment. 

JOSH
To what? 

TOBY
[sighs] To this. 

JOSH
She can't! 

SAM
She is. 

JOSH
When? 

SAM
Tonight. 

JOSH
This is why we fast tracked it! 

SAM
She's on ways and Means. 

Josh groans and turns away. 

TOBY
She was serious? This wasn't one of her funny jokes? 

SAM
She was inspired by the First Lady. She thought this morning there were trumpets and 
she doesn't want to... 

TOBY
There were trumpets? 

SAM
The trumpets called...The trumpets sounded...

TOBY
What the hell goes on at that gym? 

Josh turns back to face them. 

SAM
She thinks the train is leaving the station and she wants to be out front of it. 

JOSH
Somebody's' got to talk to Mrs. Bartlet. Tell her to get Becky Reeseman to back off. 

TOBY
[mumbles] I refuse to relay these instructions. 

JOSH
I'll talk to Lilly Mays. 

SAM
I'll do it. I'm already going in there on the Ron Ehrlich thing. 

JOSH
Okay. 

SAM
If I'm gonna take a hit, I might as well take two. [walks off and turns back]

TOBY
Press upon her the following: It's taken 7 years to get the bill this far. It's 
locked down. Add this amendment and now I've got to go back in there and be nice 
to these people! 

SAM
[nods] Yeah. [walks down the hall]

JOSH
[loudly] Bring this one home, Sam. 

Sam pumps his fist in the air. Toby and Josh turn back to the Roosevelt Room. 

JOSH
[sighs] After you. 

TOBY
After you. 

Josh looks at Toby suspiciously then enters. Toby follows. 

CUT TO: INT. DINER - DAY
Zoey and Charlie sit in a booth eating lunch. Gina sits at the counter nearby. 

ZOEY
It's called A Hundred... 

GINA 
[into cuff mic] I'll let you know when we're back on campus. 
[looks over at Zoey and Charlie]

CHARLIE
...publishing. 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
I just read a review. 

ZOEY
It's really great! It begins in the summer of 1900 when my grandmother was a child. 
[looks down at a notebook] 

CHARLIE
And I see you took notes. [takes the notebook] 

ZOEY
You know why? 

CHARLIE
Cause you're totally anal? 

ZOEY
No... [smiles] yes. 

CHARLIE
[reading] One hundred years ago the average life expectancy in the United States 
was 47? 

ZOEY
Only 14% of the homes in this country had a bathtub. 

CHARLIE
[reading] 8% of the names had a telephone. 

ZOEY
More than 95% of all births took place at home. 

CHARLIE
[reading] 90% of physicians had no college education. [smiles] This is a fun lunch, 
Zoey. We've got a little time travel thing going on. 

ZOEY
[laughs] You really want some of my egg salad, don't you? 

CHARLIE
I really do. 

Zoey laughs and glances out the window. She looks back at Charlie nervously. 

ZOEY
Do you have to get back to the office? 

CHARLIE
I've got a few minutes. 

Zoey nods after a moment. 

ZOEY
I need to talk to you about Friday night. 

CHARLIE
I took back the suit. 

ZOEY
Charlie, I... 

CHARLIE
I liked it, you didn't. That's ok. I'm here for you. I dress for you. 

ZOEY
Listen... 

CHARLIE
I picked pick up a powdered blue tuxedo with ruffles. 

ZOEY
Listen to me. 

CHARLIE
...and everything. I'm kidding about the tuxedo. 

ZOEY
Listen to me. We can't go Friday night. 

CHARLIE
That's ok. [pause] Why not? 

ZOEY
[pause] Charlie, you've been getting death threats. 

CHARLIE
From... 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
'Cause of you. 

ZOEY
Because of me and you, yeah. 

Charlie looks hurt. 

ZOEY
There's gonna be some kind of meeting or convention this weekend and... 
[glances at Gina] ...Secret Service just doesn't think... 

GINA
[walks over] We've tried to secure the place Charlie. [sits down next to Zoey]
We don't like it. Two many dark corners, back alleys doorways, windows. There's 
locks, a cellar. We can't secure the west end of the street. 

CHARLIE
[angry] I don't give a damn. 

ZOEY
Charlie.... 

CHARLIE
[angry] I don't give a damn! I bought a new suit. In fact, I've bought two now. 

ZOEY
Charlie, we can't go. 

CHARLIE
Okay. [looks down at the notebook] Hey, look. It says here that a 100 years ago a black 
guy couldn't show up to a club opening with a white girl for fear he'd be killed. 

Zoey stares out the window, upset. 

ZOEY
[to Gina] I have to go to the ladies room. 

Gina gets out and Zoey slides out. 

GINA 
[into cuff mic] Bookbag's up. [sits back down after Zoey leaves]

CHARLIE
You know, if nothing else...I think if either one of us is gonna be pissed it ought 
to be me. 

GINA
You're looking at the girl whose job it is to jump in front of a bullet. I like it 
when she stays in the dorm and watches videos. 

CHARLIE
[digs in his pockets] I gotta go. Is it all right to go? [throws down some money, 
grabs his coat and slides out]

GINA
Hey, come on! Tell her yourself. 

CHARLIE
I can't take this! [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Sam passes the staffer in the hall. 

SAM
Hey there. 

STAFFER
Hi. 

They stop. 

SAM
Is Lilly in? She's expecting me. 

STAFFER 
You can go on in. 

Sam walks into LILLY'S OFFICE. Abbey leans against Lilly's desk. Sam looks surprised. 

ABBEY
Hello, Sam. 

SAM
Mrs. Bartlet. 

ABBEY
Lilly tells me we have a problem. 

SAM
Yes, ma'am. 

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR 

FADE IN: INT. LILLY'S OFFICE - DAY
Sam and Abbey face each other. 

ABBEY
It's the tactics, Sam... 

SAM
Mrs. Bartlet.... 

ABBEY
The strategizing. And I don't understand because we used to be very close. And 
now it seems to me I have a large and energetic staff who main function seems 
to be waging war with your staff. Is that accurate? 

SAM
No ma'am. I don't think it is. 

ABBEY
We're thoroughly professional. 

SAM
No ma'am, I don't think you are. 

ABBEY
I beg your pardon? 

SAM
I like Lilly Mays. I think she's top notch, you know that. You know that it was hard 
for us to give her up. 

ABBEY
Yes? 

SAM
I think you're prone to amateur mistakes. 

ABBEY
[stiffly] So, my staff is professional, just not me. 

SAM
Mrs. Bartlet, you can't go on national television and decide to have a kid sit 
next to you on a whim. You gotta vet this stuff through my office. 

ABBEY
What was the problem with the interview? 

SAM
There was nothing wrong with the interview except it looked like you discovered 
there was a child labor problem because a 14-year-old boy named Jeffery just 
told you about it this morning. 

ABBEY
I do not believe that is true. 

SAM
And I don't not believe that exercise is gonna make me any healthier. But I 
didn't go to medical school, you did. You say so and I go to the gym.

ABBEY
Sam... 

SAM
Mrs. Bartlet, I say this with all respect but you have to talk to Becky Reeseman 
and tell her not to offer that amendment tonight. 

ABBEY
So, I will. 

SAM
[surprised] Excuse me? 

ABBEY
I said... I will. 

SAM
[nods] Okay. 

ABBEY
Is there anything else? 

SAM
No, ma'am. 

ABBEY
Okay. [leaves]

SAM
[quietly] Thank you, ma'am. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Danny waits in a chair. Charlie shuffles through papers. Mrs. Landingham looks at 
Danny then goes back to her work. 

DANNY
How you doing. Mrs. Landingham? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] Fine. Thank you, Danny. 

DANNY
[smiles] You keep glancing over like you're afraid I'm gonna steal something. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] No, I'm just not used to having members of the print media in here. 

DANNY
[smiles] I'll try not to get ink on the furniture. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles sweetly] Aw Danny. and I was just about to offer you a cookie.

DANNY
And now?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
No. [grabs some folders and stands up.] Charlie, I'll be back in a few minutes. 

Abbey enters from the Colonnade. Danny stands.

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet. [leaves]

DANNY
Good evening, ma'am. 

ABBEY
Hello! Are you covering the event? 

DANNY
The Many Women of Michigan? 

ABBEY
The Michigan Women's Democratic Caucus? 

DANNY
Ah. 

ABBEY
[smiles] Yes. 

DANNY
No. Actually, I'm here to see the President. 

ABBEY
[surprised] Really? 

DANNY
Yes. 

ABBEY
[pause] Okay. 

She plasters on a fake smile and heads towards the Mural Room. Danny glances at 
Charlie and sits back down. 

DANNY
So, what's up? 

CHARLIE
Not too much. 

DANNY
I saw you guys are going to the opening on Friday.

CHARLIE
No. 

DANNY
No? 

CHARLIE
Security. 

DANNY
Is Zoey bothered? 

CHARLIE
You know, Danny, but I say it here and 10 million people read about tomorrow. 

DANNY
Thanks for the boost in my circulation but I'm actually off the record up here. 

CHARLIE
[looks down] It's not going to work. 

DANNY
What's not going to work? 

CHARLIE
You know what I'm talking about. 

DANNY
You and Zoey? 

CHARLIE
Yeah. 

DANNY
Why? 

CHARLIE
[angry] Look, I do what I do...I go where I go. If it's a problem for the Secret 
Service that I'm black... 

DANNY
Whoa.... 

CHARLIE
...then that's the way it is. But she shouldn't expect candy and flowers, you know 
what I mean? 

DANNY 
[gets up] I know what you're saying. But I don't' think the problem is you're black. 
I think the problem is you're stupid. 

CHARLIE
Well, thanks, Danny. You picked me right up. 

DANNY
You bet. Listen, the Hardy Boys in the letters they're talking about, they may be 
heavily armed but I wouldn't put a lot of money on their marksmanship. One of these 
days they're gonna miss her and hit me. Two thousand marriage proposals, 2,000 death 
threats, a dozen bodyguards. Everyone wants to get close. Everyone wants a thing. 
Plus, and I say this standing fifteen feet from the Oval Office, life with father 
couldn't have been a real company picnic, you know. If it was me, just for now, I'd 
make sure I was the one guy in her life who was hassle free. That's just me. 

Charlie stands as Bartlet opens the door to the Oval Office and steps in. 

BARTLET
Danny... 

DANNY
Yes, sir. 

Bartlet smiles and motions for Danny to follow him. He slaps Danny on the arm and 
escorts him into THE OVAL OFFICE. Leo is sitting on the couch. 

BARTLET
Please. [motions to the couch] 

LEO
Hey, Danny. 

DANNY
Good evening, Leo. 

BARTLET
Yes. 

Danny and Bartlet sit down. 

LEO
I'd just like to say right off the bat that I strongly urged the President not 
to have this conversation. So I'm just a guy sitting here. 

BARTLET
[smiles] We note with surprise your lack of conviction, Leo. 

LEO
[grimly] Note it well, Sir. 

Danny returns Bartlet's smile. It grows awkward. 

BARTLET
I miss our late night talks, Danny. 

DANNY
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
[smiles warmly] Out there in the campaign trail.... Ames, Iowa...Tulsa... Skokie, 
Center City, Tallahassee, Albany...San Antonio, Jasper, Wyoming. 

DANNY
[smiles] Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
[nods and smiles] We got very close. 

DANNY
I'm flattered by that, sir. 

BARTLET
You covered the First Lady as well. 

DANNY
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
You literally wrote the book on my wife. 

DANNY
Yes, sir. [laughs] 

BARTLET
Once again I want to emphasize the strong personal bond we built on the campaign... 

LEO
[grimaces] Oh, for God's sake. 

DANNY
Mr. President, did you call me in to ask me if I knew who the sources are close to 
the First Lady? 

BARTLET
[shifts uncomfortably] Well, I was... going to... [looks at Leo] ...in a... proper... 
gentlemanly... 

LEO
Even Byzantine... 

BARTLET
...way... [glares at Leo]

DANNY
[shakes head] No... no... no. 

BARTLET
Danny. 

DANNY
No... no, sir. 

BARTLET
You must save me from having this conversation with my wife. 

DANNY
Mr. President... 

BARTLET
Or at least make it seem like I'm better armed than I evidently am. 

DANNY
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
[scowls] Danny... 

DANNY
I'd be revealing someone else's source. 

BARTLET
We're off the record. 

DANNY
Also, I'd get in trouble with the First Lady! 

BARTLET
Welcome to the club, Danny. We had some jackets made. 

LEO
Let him go. 

BARTLET
[sighs and smiles] Albany...Tulsa, Wichita. [laughs] I'm not kidding...a personal 
bond here, Danny.

DANNY
Sir, if makes you feel any better I just gave some very sage dating advice to Charlie 
Young. 

BARTLET
[nervously] You're coaching my Personal Aide on how to best score with my daughter? 
Yes, Danny, that does make me feel better. 

DANNY
Well, anything I can do to help, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Go away. 

DANNY
Thank you, Mr. President. 

LEO
Thanks, Danny. 

Danny leaves. 

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
The room is crowded with groups of women talking. Josh and Donna stand among the crowd. 
Donna is drinking tea. Josh looks bored. 

DONNA
It's an interesting book. 

JOSH
The Hundred Years ago thing? 

DONNA
Some medical authorities warned that professional seamstress were apt become sexually 
aroused by the steady rhythm of foot pedals. They recommended slipping bromide, which 
was thought to diminish a woman' sexual desires into their drinking water. 

JOSH
Why would anyone want to diminish a woman's sexual desires? 

DONNA
We can get out of hand. 

Josh looks surprised. They watch as Abbey enters. 

JOSH
Here we go. 

She walks over to a group of women, including Becky Reeseman. 

ABBEY
Excuse me. 

WOMAN
Good evening. 

ABBEY
Would you mind if I had a word with Congresswoman Reeseman?

WOMAN
Well, sure! 

REESEMAN
I'll find you later. 

The other women leave. 

REESEMAN
[to Abbey] That's a beautiful suit. 

ABBEY
Becky, did you decide to run for the Senate and not tell me?

REESEMAN
[surprised] Abbey... [laughs nervously] 

ABBEY
Cause you know Jed and I will be there with whatever you need. 

REESEMAN
I know the amendment comes as a bit of a surprise but... 

ABBEY
Your Child Labor amendment is a poison pill. It will kill the GFTMAA is the following 
way: The Republican leadership will allow their guys to wear the black hats and they'll 
be released from a party line vote. This will surprised but not shock the Democratic 
leadership because they've seen it before. The vote will pass the House cause that's 
how sure they are that it will never pass the Senate and what's more you know it. 

REESEMAN
I felt like the train was leaving the station, Abbey. 

ABBEY
When the trains leaving the station you'll know that too.

REESEMAN
There is a Senate seat open you know. 

ABBEY
And I'm sure the President will do what he can for you.

REESEMAN
I've heard that before, Abbey. 

ABBEY
We're not in the back of Steve's boat now, Becky. Don't bargain with me here. 

REESEMAN
I put this amendment back in my pocket like you told me to and I'm going to have 
problems of my own. 

ABBEY
How many people know? 

REESEMAN
You, Steve, my staff, I'm sure by now the President's staff... 

ABBEY
Then you're fine.

REESEMAN
Wait. Excuse me. Am I supposed to trust the President's staff? 

ABBEY
Yes. Are we done? 

REESEMAN
[pause] Yes. 

ABBEY
Thank you. 

Reeseman watches her leave. 

CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo sits in a chair reading from the "Hundred Years" book to Bartlet. 

BARTLET
The rhythm of the sewing machine petals? 

LEO
That's what it says. [reading] "Marijuana, heroin, morphine were all available over 
the counter in drug stores. According to one Pharmacist, heroin clears the completion, 
gives buoyancy to the mind, regulates the stomach and bowels and is in fact the perfect 
guardian of health." Now they tell me. 

Bartlet laughs. Mrs. Landingham knocks and enters.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President... 

LEO
[jumps to his feet] I'm outta here. 

BARTLET
Stay. 

LEO
Right. 

BARTLET
Chicken. 

Bartlet looks at his watch as Leo quickly leaves. Bartlet looks nervous. Abbey enters. 

ABBEY
[tight smile] Hello. 

BARTLET
Hello. 

ABBEY
Hello, pumpkin. 

Mrs. Landingham closes the door. Abbey drops her suit coat over the back of a chair. 

BARTLET
Abbey? 

ABBEY
Hello, gumdrop. 

BARTLET
[nervously] Listen... [quickly walks to the door and closes it]

ABBEY
[tight smile] Sam Seaborn came to see my Chief of Staff today. In fact, he did it twice. 

BARTLET
Well, your Chief of Staff is a very attractive woman. Maybe he was, you know... 

ABBEY
Jed... 

BARTLET
Abbey, I told C.J. specifically... 

ABBEY
Then C.J. got the signal wrong. 

BARTLET 
[contrite] No, she didn't. 

ABBEY
What? 

BARTLET
She didn't get the signal wrong. I wanted her to send someone. 

ABBEY
Are you telling me... 

BARTLET
This wire thing is a problem for me. The kid on TV was a mistake. And the amendment, 
from Becky Reeseman... 

ABBEY
I just killed it. 

BARTLET
...will bring down a trade bill that's been worked on for years. 

ABBEY
I said I just killed it. 

BARTLET
[nods] Fine.

ABBEY
Jed, we share a bed. Why didn't you just come to me? 

BARTLET
I staffed it out to C.J.. 

ABBEY
[angry] You staffed it out. 

BARTLET
That's right. 

ABBEY
[angry] You don't staff me out. 

Bartlet paces, puts his hand on his head.

ABBEY
[angry] You don't give C.J. signals. You don't send Sam. And you don't bring Danny 
Concannon up here. [loudly] Don't handle me, Jed! 

BARTLET
[yells, bangs on the desk] Then don't play me, Abbey! Don't work me! A lot of people 
around here think it was Lilly Mays, who planted you have a preference for Ron Erlich! 

ABBEY
It wasn't Lilly Mays. 

BARTLET
[loudly] I know it wasn't Lilly Mays. It was you! 

ABBEY
[angry] Yes! 

BARTLET
[angry] Yes! 

ABBEY
Yes! And I'm sorry about that, but I wanted Ron to know that he had my support. 

BARTLET
[angry] Well you put me in a bit of a spot there, Abigail. I name Ron Erlich now, 
which I was going to do anyway, and it makes me look like I'm taking instructions 
from my wife! 

ABBEY
[loudly] Still it was wrong! 

BARTLET
Are you talking about you or me? 

ABBEY
[loudly] I'm talking about you. I'm talking about you sending people to me. And I tell 
you what else I'm talking about. I'm talking about you waiting a day to name a new fed 
chair, because thirty years ago the new fed chair was my boyfriend for six months. 

BARTLET
[sternly] I'm talking about sending me messages through the press, and staking out 
agendas on morning shows. We are not going to be these people, Abbey. I'm not gonna 
do it! [loudly] I'll walk up to the hill right now, and I will give the Speaker of 
the House my resignation. 

ABBEY
The house isn't in session. 

BARTLET
[yelling] Do you want to see me get on the phone and put it in session?! 

ABBEY
[clipped] Don't raise your voice to me! 

BARTLET
[yelling] It was nine months, Abbey. Not six months. And I waited a day on Skippy, 
because the fed chair is a fairly important position, and I wanted to make damn 
sure my decision was right. 

ABBEY
[yelling] You already made your decision! 

BARTLET
How the hell do you know? 

ABBEY
[yelling] You just said so. "I name Ron Erlich now, which I was gonna do 
anyway. It looks like I'm taking instructions from... my... wife!" 

BARTLET
Yes. 

ABBEY
Yes. 

BARTLET
Yes. 

Bartlet paces as they both cool off. 

ABBEY
Okay. So just ease up on the high ground. 

BARTLET
On that point I concede the high ground. 

ABBEY
Then I concede I was wrong about the thing. 

BARTLET
Good. 

ABBEY
However... 

BARTLET
No, no however. Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong, and 
get used to it. 

ABBEY
However... 

BARTLET
Nine months, Abbey. 

ABBEY
However... 

BARTLET
Yes? 

ABBEY
I'm still gonna kick your ass on child labor. 

BARTLET
Abbey, please. 

ABBEY
Jed, if it was one of our girls in that factory, you'd send in the Marines. 

BARTLET
[looks thoughtful and nods] Yeah. 

ABBEY
[quietly] Yeah. 

BARTLET
Okay. [pause] We just had our first Oval Office fight. 

ABBEY
[sighs] Yeah. 

Abbey turns and leans on the edge of his desk. Bartlet puts his hands in his pockets 
and walks around the desk. 

BARTLET
Did you talk to Zoey today? [leans next to her, avoiding her gaze] 

ABBEY
She went back to her dorm. She and Charlie had a fight cause the Service doesn't 
want them to show up at this thing together. [gazes at him] 

BARTLET
Maybe she'll be so traumatized by this experience, that she'll never date another 
boy again. 

ABBEY
Well, he left here a little while ago and...I'd say that in about an hour the lights 
will be off, there'll be a sock on the doorknob, and who... 

BARTLET
Don't finish that sentence, I'm a man of questionable health. [glances at her sideways] 
The Michigan women are waiting for me. 

ABBEY
Okay. 

Abbey smiles as he puts his arm around her shoulders and they walk towards 
the door. He drops her jacket around her shoulders and they exit.

DISSOLVE TO: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
Charlie walks up the crowded hallway with flowers. He stops and Zoey's door and knocks. 
While he waits, he turns and looks at Gina in the dorm room across the hall. She looks 
up at him from the book she's reading. Zoey answers her door and glares at Charlie. 

CHARLIE 
[quietly] Hi. 

ZOEY
[coldly] Yes? 

CHARLIE 
I came to apologize. 

ZOEY
You left me sitting in a restaurant. 

CHARLIE 
I feel bad about that. 

ZOEY
Are there other things to feel bad about too? 

CHARLIE 
Yes. 

ZOEY
Name them, please. 

CHARLIE 
I... 

Gina smiles at them.

CHARLIE
Off the top of my head I wouldn't be able to give you a comprehensive list. Just 
suffice it to say that anything I've done to upset you even if it exists in your 
kind of confused little mind, I really apologize for. 

ZOEY
[smiles and steps towards him] What did you bring me? 

CHARLIE 
I brought you flowers. [hands her the flowers]

ZOEY
Oh, I can see that. What else? 

CHARLIE 
A book. [hands her a book] 

ZOEY
[reading] Introduction to Advanced Trigonometry. 

Gina laughs and puts down her book. 

CHARLIE 
Your father made me pick it up. 

ZOEY
What else? 

CHARLIE 
Popcorn. 

ZOEY
Why the popcorn? 

CHARLIE 
'Cause I brought videos. 

ZOEY
Get in here. 

Zoey smiles at him. Charlie smiles at Gina as Zoey pulls him inside and closes the door. 
Gina exits her room.

GINA 
[into cuff mic] Bookbag is in for the night.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
THURSDAY, 9:45 P.M. 
Bonnie is holding a champagne bottle, and a lot of other staffers are gathered around 
a T.V. listening to Mendoza's confirmation vote.

T.V. [VO]
Senator Crossfield. 

CROSSFIELD [VO]
Yea.

T.V. [VO]
Senator Crossfield votes yea.

BONNIE
Congratulations everybody. Congratulations. Line up. Only one drink per person. Who's 
driving?

People come to her with glasses. Crystal. Toby walks in.

TOBY
Put it down! Put it down! Put it down!

BONNIE
Toby...

TOBY
No champagne.

BONNIE
We're just getting ready to...

TOBY
Put it down. Everyone in this room let me have your attention, please. The law of our 
land mandates that Presidential appointees be confirmed by a majority of the Senate. 
A majority being half plus one for a total of what, Ginger?

GINGER
51.

TOBY
51 yea votes is what we see on the screen before a drop of wine is swallowed! Because 
there's a little thing called what, Bonnie?

BONNIE
Tempting fate?

TOBY
“Tempting fate” is what it's called. [starts collecting champagne glasses from everyone]
In the three months this man has been on my radar screen, I have aged 48 years. This is 
my day of jubilee and I will not have it screwed up by what, Bonnie?

BONNIE
By tempting fate.

TOBY
By tempting fate! These things take patience. These things take skill. These things take 
luck. In the 15 months we've been in office, what kind of luck have we had, Ginger?

GINGER
Bad luck.

TOBY
What kind of luck?

GINGER
Very bad luck.

TOBY
We've had very bad luck. [beat] Where's Josh?

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Donna is rushing into his office. 

DONNA
Josh!

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
We got to go. They’re already 19 yea votes.

Donna gets to his office. Josh is standing and holding up a note.

JOSH
What's this message about I've got to talk to Mandy about a banana bar? Is that what 
this says?

DONNA
Panda bear.

JOSH
“Panda bear?”

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
[walks around and shows her the note] That's a “d”?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
And that's an “e”?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
All right, you know what would be helpful? If you could just show me where one word 
ends and the next one begins.

DONNA
We have to go.

JOSH
She wants to talk to me about a panda bear?

They walk out into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
You're sure you got the message right?

DONNA
Have I ever gotten a message wrong?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Then maybe the benefit of the doubt might not be monumentally out of line.

JOSH
A panda’s what I think it is, right?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Little Australian thing, eats bark off a koala tree?

DONNA
That's a koala bear I believe you're describing.

JOSH
The panda's the other one...

DONNA
How can you not know the difference between a panda bear and a koala bear?

They go into the NORTHWEST LOBBY. They stop because a photographer is taking a picture 
of someone.

JOSH
You know, for someone who hasn't quite mastered the alphabet...

Mallory enters the White House and walks up to them.

MALLORY
Josh!

Josh and Donna start walking again.

DONNA
My penmanship is distinctive.

JOSH
Your penmanship is illegible. Hey, Mal.

MALLORY
Where's Sam?

JOSH
He's going to be watching the Mendoza vote.

MALLORY
Can you believe him?

JOSH
Sam?

MALLORY
Yeah.

JOSH 
Can I believe him?

MALLORY
Yeah.

They cut the corner into a HALLWAY.

JOSH
No.

MALLORY
You think you know a guy...

JOSH
Yeah.

MALLORY
You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

JOSH
No.

MALLORY
Okay.

JOSH
Okay.

Josh, Donna and Mallory walk into THE MURAL ROOM. Toby is tense watching T.V. 
The staffers are sitting around. No longer in the party mood, just in wait. 

JOSH
Toby!

TOBY
Joshua.

JOSH
How about some champagne?

CROWD
No...

JOSH
What the hell?

TOBY
Ginger?

GINGER
Tempting fate.

JOSH
Okay. [to Donna] Go grab Leo.

DONNA
It's distinctive penmanship style, Josh.

JOSH
Go.

DONNA
Not unlike Salvador Dali.

JOSH
Please get Leo.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is on the phone. Margaret taps on the door.

LEO
[into phone] I can't believe you're talking like this.

MARGARET
Leo?

LEO
[into phone] It's a book jacket, Sydney. It's a dust cover.

MARGARET
[walks to the desk] Leo?

LEO
[into phone] We're really going to make a federal case out of a book jacket? I mean 
we're literally going to make a federal case out of this?

MARGARET
Donna says it's time.

LEO
[still into phone] Sydney, I'm going to bring him up here and talk to him, but I got to 
say... we're about a minute and a half from closing what wasn't the easiest confirmation 
process in American history, so you'll understand if I'm not giddy as a schoolgirl about 
the thought of running once again into the warm embrace of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

MARGARET
Leo...

LEO
Goodbye.

Leo hangs up. He walks out with Margaret into the HALLWAY.

MARGARET
What was that?

LEO
An appointment to a Justice post favors reparations to African-Americans.

MARGARET
What for?

LEO
Capturing their ancestors and keeping them as slaves.

MARGARET
What kind of reparations?

LEO
Money.

They walk inside THE MURAL ROOM. The crowd is yelling to a “nay” vote for Mendoza on 
the television.

CROWD
Boo!

JOSH
Loser!

Margaret hurries to sit with a friend. Mallory hugs Leo at the door. The next vote is 
a “yea.”

CROWD
Yeah! [claps]

SAM
[walks in] Toby!

TOBY
Not yet.

SAM
Our day of jubilee.

TOBY
Not yet.

Mallory was standing behind him, and pops him on the shoulder.

MALLORY
Sam.

SAM
[spins around] It's my day of jubilee.

MALLORY
I despise you and everything you stand for.

SAM
All right, the day was a little bit better a few seconds ago, but that's all right.

MALLORY
How could you write that position paper?

SAM
Which position paper?

MALLORY
Don't play dumb with me.

SAM
No, honestly I am dumb. Most of the time I'm playing smart.

MALLORY
Sam, the position paper...

SAM
Mallory, you can't be thinking about ruining my day of jubilee by yelling at me about 
school vouchers.

MALLORY
I was strongly considering it, yes.

SAM
Mallory...

JOSH
50! Here we go, baby!

LEO
Sam. Toby. You're about to put a guy on the Supreme Court.

The crowd is silent.

T.V. [VO]
Senator Rindell.

RINDELL [VO]
Yea.

Massive cheering. Even Toby, who was holding a bottle of champagne in his lap, smiles 
and puts up his hands in victory.

SAM
Toby? How about now?

Toby opens the bottle, the champagne foams up and all over his lap as he stands.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
THURSDAY, 11:30 P.M. 
After the celebration, Josh is sprawled on a chair by the fireplace. Donna is on the 
couch.

JOSH
I don't understand. Salvador Dali had distinctive penmanship?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
How was it distinctive?

DONNA
Well, for one thing, he wrote in Spanish.

JOSH
He was Spanish.

DONNA
Which would account for his distinctive penmanship.

LEO
[walks up] Excuse me. Am I interrupting something important?

JOSH
I can't even begin to tell you how you're not.

LEO
[giggles] [to Donna] Would you mind if I have a...



DONNA
[gets up and picks up her shoes] I'll go see if people are having fun in the other room.
[leaves]

JOSH
What's up?

LEO
Our nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.

JOSH
It's going to sail?

LEO
No, it's not.

JOSH
Jeff Breckenridge?

LEO
Stadler has a problem with him.

JOSH
What's his problem?

LEO
He supports slavery reparations.

JOSH
Since when?

LEO
Whenever.

JOSH
I mean... was there a thing? [stands]

LEO
Two sentences on the back dust jacket of a book that's coming out called The Unpaid Debt.

JOSH
That's it?

LEO
Stadler's unhappy.

JOSH
Cause of a thing he wrote on a dust cover?

LEO
I've been singing that song for the last three hours. So talk to him tomorrow, would you?

JOSH
Stadler?

LEO
Breckenridge.

JOSH
I'm not the guy for this.

LEO
Yeah, you are.

We hear the crowd from the other room.

LEO
What the hell is that?

JOSH
C.J.'s going to do “The Jackal.” 

LEO
Oh, where she lip synchs to the thing?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
[smiles] I love that.

JOSH
Toby's better for this. Look at the job he did on the Mendoza confirmation.

LEO
Toby's barely alive as a result of the Mendoza confirmation. This one's you. Let's go 
watch “The Jackal.”

Leo walks, Josh follows into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Leo...

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
I'm a white guy from Connecticut.

LEO
We've met, Josh.

JOSH
I'm saying, isn't this kind of a delicate subject for me to get into with a black civil 
rights lawyer from Athens, Georgia?

LEO
Remember, you're also Jewish.

JOSH
Then he's sure to love me.

LEO
Yeah.

They meet up with Cathy, walking down the hall.

LEO
Cathy! Where's Sam?

CATHY
In his office, fighting with your daughter.

LEO
Tell him to come to the Press Room. He's not going to want to miss “The Jackal.”

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Mallory and Sam are in his office and having a discussion.

SAM
It was a position paper.

MALLORY
And your position is that school vouchers are a good idea?

SAM
How did you get this paper?

MALLORY
I'm related to your boss.

SAM
Your father gave you my position paper?

MALLORY
Yes.

SAM
See. I think he's trying to drive a wedge between us.

MALLORY
It worked.

SAM
Look...

Knock on the door.

CATHY
Sam.

SAM
Yes?

CATHY
C.J.'s doing “The Jackal.”

SAM
I'll be right there.

MALLORY
I thought we had something going on, Sam.

SAM
We do.

MALLORY
And yet you haven't told me that you favor school vouchers?

SAM
I... first of all, hang on. We haven't been on a date yet.

MALLORY
I'm saying...

SAM
And what kind of dates have you had that you're amazed this hasn't come up?

MALLORY
I'm a public school teacher.

SAM
Seriously. The other guys. They order drinks and they say, "Before we go any further, 
I'd like you to know my position on school vouchers?"

MALLORY
Are you going to have a serious discussion with me about this?

SAM
No.

MALLORY
No?

SAM
No. Because you know why? Because I am off duty. Toby and I have spent the last three 
months putting a guy on the bench. The sun has set and I have earned my government 
salary and then some. I'm done working. And we haven't been out on a date and that's 
supposed to be tonight. Now we’re going to go in there and watch C.J. do “The Jackal.” 
And believe me, if you haven't seen C.J. do “The Jackal,” then you haven't seen 
Shakespeare the way it was meant to be done. We're going to watch C.J. do “The Jackal” 
and then we're going to get a late dinner, after which I may or may not kiss you good 
night. ‘Cause there is something going on between us, Mallory. But frankly, I don't 
think you're doing a very good job on your part, so I've decided to take over.

MALLORY
You're taking over?

SAM
Yes. Let's go.

MALLORY
Not much chance.

SAM
I didn't think so, but you got to give me credit for trying.

MALLORY
Good night there, Skipper. [leaves]

SAM
Apparently you don't have to give me credit for trying.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
The crowd is thick to watch. Toby pushes a button on the radio. The jazz plays. Toby 
is smiling. C.J. is in the middle of the room, and the crowd encourages her to begin. 
C.J. pantomimes and lip synchs to “The Jackal.”

C.J.
“He was fat black cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin’ at a quarter 
after five. Twist of lime. Coke on the side. The brother loved the high life. Had a 
PhD in Street Strife. They called him the Jackal... The Jackal.”

The crowd loves it. The singer laughs, with a great deep voice. Josh claps and makes 
his way toward Toby, who’s smoking a cigar.

JOSH
There's a little speed bump with Jeff Breckenridge. Leo gave it to me because he thinks 
you're burned out after Mendoza. I said I thought that was ridiculous. What do you think?

TOBY
[long pause] Are you talking to me... during “The Jackal?”

JOSH
I was just...

Toby actually bops up and down! He is one giddy man, smiling, a giggle in his voice.

TOBY
Never talk to me during “The Jackal.”

JOSH
Sure.

Toby blows smoke rings.

C.J.
“He was big Mack daddy super black stylin’ a diamonds in the back Cadillac. Fur lined 
boards. White walled wheels. Cruise control. Built for speed. Chrome on everything. 
And the stereophonic speakers. But he really didn't need them. When they called him... 
The Jackal.”

The crowd claps. Leo is watching with a smile on his face as Sam walks to him.

SAM
Hey.

LEO
Hey.

SAM
So Mallory read my position paper on school vouchers.

LEO
Really?

SAM
Yeah.

LEO
How do you suppose she got a hold of that?

SAM
Well, as it turns out, you gave it to her.

LEO
Hmmm. School vouchers is a serious subject with Mallory.

SAM
Yeah, thanks for the heads up.

LEO
I don't mind you dating my only daughter, but you can't expect me not to have some fun 
along the way.

SAM
Mallory and I haven't actually been on a date yet.

LEO
Well, you hang in there, son.

C.J.
“Fly boy was in the buttermilk hard. Livin' fast. Livin' large. Six foot four and not 
an ounce of fat. When women ask, "Is you a proud cat?" He'd say, "Oh, dear. I'm more 
than that. I'm the roanest of the roan. And in case you hadn't known... They call me 
The Jackal. The Jackal... The Jackal.”

The crowd applauds as the jazz fades.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT
C.J. is at her desk, humming, back to the door as Danny walks in. He sees her move her 
hips to a song.

DANNY
You did “The Jackal?”

C.J.
What are you doing here so late?

DANNY
I missed “The Jackal?”

C.J.
I was on fire tonight.

DANNY
Congratulations on Mendoza, that's got to feel good.

C.J.
It does. [takes a gulp of champagne]

DANNY
So I'm home. By myself. Listening to my police scanner.

C.J.
You have a police scanner?

DANNY
Yes, I do.

C.J.
Danny, you were like, President of your high school audio-visual club, weren't you?

DANNY
I was, in fact, not President of the AV Club. I was vice-President. Bobby Pfeiffer was 
President, and that's something I don't like to talk about.

C.J.
Why'd you come down?

DANNY
Josh said to come by for a drink.

C.J. puts on her scarf. She's going home.

C.J.
You should have gotten here earlier.

DANNY
I would have, except I was home listening to my police scanner.

C.J.
What happened?

DANNY
David Arbor was arrested outside a frat party. He's going to be charged with felony 
possession and possible intent to distribute.

C.J.
Is there any chance David Arbor is not the son of Bob Arbor?

DANNY
There's not any chance of that. No. Plus one other thing...

C.J.
One, there's one other thing?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
What?

DANNY
Zoey was at the frat party.

C.J.
Well, at least I know what I'll be doing when I come into work tomorrow. [starts to take 
off her coat]

DANNY
Speaking of tomorrow, when you start handing out information, please remember I came down 
here at one in the morning to tell you this when there was no earthly reason that I had 
to, and also that you're secretly in love with me.

C.J.
Make sure you remind my office.

DANNY
You could do “The Jackal” for me. Right here, right now.

She flips his scarf over his shoulder and rubs his arm.

C.J.
Go home.

DANNY
Okay.

Danny exits. C.J. picks up the phone.

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Carol are walking and talking.

C.J.
Do this... I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.

CAROL
I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.

C.J.
Yeah, you know why? Because it's such a non-story it hasn't come up yet today. Say it now.

CAROL
I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.

C.J.
The kid's father's a major Democratic fundraiser.

CAROL
And I'm sure the President would offer him his best wishes and support during what must 
be a troubling time.

C.J.
The President’s daughter was at a party where there was a drug bust.

They go inside C.J.'S OFFICE.

CAROL
Zoey left the party well before the incident.

C.J.
Has the President had any reaction at all?

CAROL
I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.

C.J.
There it is.

Carol leaves. Mandy comes from the other door.

MANDY
Hey, C.J.

C.J.
It's a non-story.

MANDY
Let's keep it that way.

Mandy taps on Josh's open office door. She walks inside JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh is sitting 
with his feet on his desk.

JOSH
Hey.

MANDY
Did you get my message?

JOSH
Yeah, you didn't want to talk to me about banana bars by any chance, did you?

MANDY
Panda bears.

JOSH
Donna has stylish penmanship.

MANDY
I think we should get a panda bear.

JOSH
You say that now, but I'm the one who's going to end up feeding him and walking him.

MANDY
You guys have gotten something more than 3000 letters in the last ten days, wanting to 
know when we're getting a new bear for the National Zoo?

JOSH
What happened to the old bear?

MANDY
Lum-Lum?

JOSH
Okay.

MANDY
She died two weeks ago.

JOSH
Did I kill her?

MANDY
No.

JOSH
Then what are you talking to me for?

MANDY
3,000 letters in 10 days.

JOSH
Did I write any of them?

MANDY
No.

JOSH
Then once again...

MANDY
Who should I be talking to?

JOSH
About getting a new panda bear?

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
To replace Lum-Lum?

MANDY
Yes.

JOSH
Toby. You should be talking to Toby. 

Donna walks in with files. Lots of files, and sets them on the chair in front of Josh's 
desk. She hands him the top one.

DONNA
This is most of it.

JOSH
Thanks.

Donna leaves.

MANDY
Toby?

JOSH
Yeah. Toby can help you out.

MANDY
What's all this?

JOSH
I have to tell a black civil rights lawyer why I don't owe him any money.

MANDY
Good luck.

JOSH
Thanks.

About a dozen.

Mike goes. Gina goes to Zoey's table where she's there with friends, one of which is STACY. 

ZOEY
What time is it?

GIRL
12:30.

ZOEY
I have to go.

GIRL
Are we doing French in Kelly’s room tonight?

ZOEY
Yeah, about 10.

Okay.

Zoey and Stacy start to leave.

GINA
Zoey. This way, we're going out back.

ZOEY
What's out front?

GINA
There's a reporter out there.

STACY
They're not supposed to come on campus.

GINA
Campus security's on its way.

ZOEY
[to Stacy] Can I ask you a question? What is up with Marjorie’s hair?

STACY
Yes, I know! I didn’t want to say anything back at the table. [They both giggle.]

ZOEY
[to Gina] Gina, listen to this... we've been falling asleep listening to our French tapes. 

GINA
I remember them well.

ZOEY
Are you ready?

ZOEY and STACY
Michelle, Anne, Vous travaillez? Ah. Non. Nous regardons le television. Porquois?

They walk into the KITCHEN. Gina is ahead and a reporter, EDGAR DRUMM, runs in view.

EDGAR DRUMM
Zoey!

Gina knocks him back to the freezer.

DRUMM
Hey!

GINA
I'm Special Agent Gina Toscano of the U.S. Secret Service, what's your name?

DRUMM
Edgar Drumm of the Charleston Citizen. I have a question for Miss Bartlet.

GINA
She doesn't answer questions here.

DRUMM
Yeah. Zoey.

Gina turns around and Mike is there.

GINA
Mike, take her to the car.

DRUMM
Zoey, what do you think it says about the country that the President's daughter is 
partying with drug dealers?

ZOEY
What the hell?

STACY
Can you believe it?

DRUMM
What do you think it says about the country?

STACY
David Arbor isn't a drug dealer.

GINA
Stacy...

DRUMM
Yeah, why'd you go to the party, Zoey?

ZOEY
[was heading off, but spins around] I was invited. I didn't even know David Arbor was 
going to be there.

GINA
Guys! I want you in the car now.

The girls and Mike walk to the car.

STACY
You're a real jackass, you know that?

Drumm laughs. He got a quote. He takes out his notebook.

GINA
Don't ever do that again.

DRUMM
I have to say if this is how the Secret Service behaves in the Bartlet Administration, 
it's a sad state of affairs.

GINA
We're all going to have to learn to live with your disappointment. [smiles pleasantly 
and then heads off]

The noon meeting with Brennan and Landis on the Hill?

CATHY
Yeah?

SAM
Let's see if we can cancel it.

CATHY
Why?

SAM
I don't want to go.

CATHY
That's not a good enough reason.

I really don't want to go.

You're going.

Okay. [heads back to his office]

CATHY
And you've got Mallory at eleven.

You've got Mallory at eleven. Right now.

What do you mean I've got Mallory?

CATHY
Your appointment with Mallory.

What appointment with Mallory?

MALLORY
[appears] I decided to see you during your business hours.

SAM
Mallory.

MALLORY
Hello.

SAM
Why aren't you in school?

MALLORY
No school today.

SAM
You made an appointment?

MALLORY
I didn't want to take advantage of the fact that we're dating.

SAM
We're not dating.

MALLORY
That's kinda sad for you, isn't it?

SAM
You made an appointment?

MALLORY
All nice and business like.

Josh straightens his desk, then JEFF BRECKENRIDGE comes in.

JEFF BRECKENRIDGE
Thank you.

JOSH
Jeff, I'm Josh Lyman.

JEFF
Jeff Breckenridge.

They shake hands. Josh motions for him to sit.

JOSH
Good to meet you. Help yourself to a chair. Can Donna get you anything?

JEFF
No, thank you. I'm fine. [sits]

JOSH
You were a second year summer intern at Debevoise and Plimpton when my father was a 
partner there. [sits]

JEFF
Your father was a partner at Debevoise and Plimpton?

JOSH
Yeah.

JEFF
Your father’s Noah Lyman?

JOSH
Yeah.

JEFF
I met him. He's a wonderful man. How is he?

JOSH
He died.

JEFF
I'm sorry. When?

JOSH
The night of the Illinois primary.

JEFF
I'm sorry.

JOSH
Thanks. Listen. I just got this handed to me last night, so I'm not as up to speed as 
I'd like.

JEFF
A couple of Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have a problem with me.

JOSH
Stadler.

JEFF
Also probably Wachtel and Tellison.

JOSH
Probably.

JEFF
Any specific problem or they just don't like me on spec?

JOSH
No. 
[laughs a little] There's a book coming out by Otis Hastings called The Unpaid Debt. 
Hastings' position is that African Americans are owed monetary reparations for slavery.

JEFF
Yes.

JOSH
You're quoted on the back jacket.

JEFF
Yes.

JOSH looks at the book on his desk.

JOSH
You wrote, "Otis Hastings is a unique and extraordinary historian. This book should be 
read by everyone and burned into the minds of white America."

JEFF
Yes.

JOSH
Just to start, you weren't misquoted... right?

JEFF
No.

JOSH
Okay. And I'm assuming that if asked by the Committee, you'll say that you favor 
reparations?

JEFF
If asked, I'll tell the Committee that my father's fathers were kidnapped outside a 
village called Wimbabwa, brought to New Guinea, sold to a slave trader from Boston 
and bought by a plantation owner in Wadsworth, South Carolina, where they worked... 
for no wages.

JOSH
And you're looking for back pay?

JEFF
Yes.

JOSH
Just out of curiosity... did you have a figure in mind?

JEFF
Dr. Harold Washington, who's chief economist at the Manchester Institute, calculated 
the number of slaves held, multiplied it by the number of hours worked, multiplied that 
by the market value of manual labor and came up with a very conservative figure.

JOSH
What is it?

JEFF
1.7 trillion dollars.

Josh was taking a sip of coffee that he's now having a hard time swallowing.

JOSH
Okay. Listen, this is probably a better discussion to have in the abstract, don't you 
think?

JEFF
No.

JOSH
What do you mean?

JEFF
I mean someone owes me and my friends 1.7 trillion dollars.

C.J.
Yes indeed. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Chaz.

CHARLIE
I hear you burned the place down last night.

C.J.
“The Jackal?”

CHARLIE
Yeah.

C.J.
I can bring it. What's up?

CHARLIE
Zoey called.

C.J.
What'd she do?

CHARLIE
She had a little run-in on campus with a reporter named Edgar Drumm who writes for a 
newspaper called the Charleston Citizen.

C.J.
Edgar Drumm isn't a reporter. He's a professional Bartlet baiter, and the Charleston 
Citizen isn't a newspaper, it's fund-raising newsletter for the radical right. What'd 
he ask her?

CHARLIE
He asked her if the President's daughter should be partying with drug dealers.

C.J.
Did she talk to him?

CHARLIE
Gina put her in the car. The thing she wanted me to ask you about was this... David 
Arbor's a good friend and she really loves him a lot and he's not a drug dealer and 
she wanted to see what you could do about nipping that in the bud.

C.J.
I can talk to a couple of people.

CHARLIE
The guy doesn't sell drugs. He just buys them, takes them and gets unconscious. Zoey 
and her friends are trying to help him. In fact, Zoey was bringing him back the car 
keys she confiscated from him last week.

C.J.
[calls] Carol!?

CHARLIE
The guy drives a Porsche.

CAROL
[comes to the door] Yeah.

C.J.
Tell Danny I'm coming to see him.

CAROL
Sure.

C.J.
I drove my boyfriend's Porsche once.

CHARLIE
How'd it go?

C.J.
Backed it into a pond.

CHARLIE
Lost your driving privileges?

C.J.
And the boyfriend.

CHARLIE

TOBY

MARGARET
You usually growl something inaudible.

TOBY
Not today.

TOBY
You, on the other hand, should turn that frown upside down.

Let your smile be your umbrella, Margaret.

Okay, now you're scaring the crap out of me, Toby.

Margaret walks off. Toby walks and sings.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE  - DAY
Mallory and Sam are in the middle of a deep discussion.

MALLORY
Tax dollars should go to public schools, not aiding the shipment of students to private 
schools, many of which are religious. And by the way, I don't know how you’re getting 
around the separation of Church and State on that one.

SAM
We have people on the payroll who are experts at obfuscating the Constitution.

MALLORY
So I've noticed.

SAM
Anything else?

MALLORY
Oh, yes. [pulls out her list from his position paper]

We're offering a solution for that.

MALLORY
You're offering a lifeboat to the select few for whom vouchers will make any kind of 
difference.

SAM
Mallory, everything that you're saying makes sense. I just think that the state of 
urban schools is such that if you can save even one kid...

MALLORY
[stands] You can save more than one kid.

SAM
Tell me how.

MALLORY
By asking Congress to approve, not just a little, but a lot more money for public 
education.

Sam laughs.

MALLORY
What?

SAM
[stands] Public education has been a public policy disaster for 40 years. Having spent 
around four trillion dollars on public schools since 1965, the result has been a steady 
and inexorable decline in every measurable standard of student performance, to say 
nothing of health and safety. But don't worry about it, because the U.S. House of 
Representatives is on the case. I feel better already.

MALLORY
[beat] Wow.

SAM
What?

MALLORY
For a guy who's trying to date me, that was pretty snotty.

SAM
Well, hang on. These are office hours. If I'd know I was working on that I would have 
had a whole different attitude.

CATHY
[comes in] Sam...

SAM
Thank God.

CATHY
The meeting on the Hill?

SAM
The meeting on the Hill. I'd love to keep talking, Mal, but I have this meeting on the 
Hill.

CATHY
I canceled it.

SAM
Why?

CATHY
You asked me to.

SAM
Yes, I did.

Cathy leaves.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY
Danny is typing at his desk. C.J. walks to him.

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
You hear anything about Edgar Drumm talking to Zoey?

DANNY
You know what you never do?

C.J.
What?

DANNY
You never tell me you like my suspenders.

C.J.
Danny.

DANNY
I'm just saying...

C.J.
Edgar Drumm.

DANNY
He asked her if the President's daughter should be partying with drug dealers.

C.J.
That's what I heard. [gets up to walk away]

DANNY
She said she didn't know Arbor was going to be there. 

C.J.
[turns around] What? 

DANNY
It’s Edgar Drumm, C.J. No one...

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
It's Edgar Drumm. No one...

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
What?

C.J.
Nothing.

DANNY
What?

C.J.
Nothing. Those really are nice suspenders.

C.J. leaves.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh and Jeff are still in their meeting.

JEFF
Special Field Order Number 15.

JOSH
What? [sits back at his desk with another cup of coffee]

JEFF
I'm saying slavery reparations aren't anything new. January 16th, 1865, General Sherman 
issued Special Field Order Number 15. Nearly a half million acres from South Carolina 
to Florida were divided up into 40 acre plots and given to newly freed slaves. He also 
granted them the use of various decommissioned army supplies including...

JOSH
Mules.

JEFF
Yes.

JOSH
40 acres and a mule.

JEFF
Yes. But the order was rescinded four years later by Andrew Johnson. In the ‘60s, during 
the Newark riots, you could hear the looters shouting, "That was my 40 acres, I'll be 
back for the mule." [drinks coffee]

JOSH
Catchy.

JEFF
See, if you guys had just paid up on time...

JOSH
A lesson well learned. But let's talk about your confirmation.

JEFF
Absolutely.

JOSH
And while we're on the subject of the Civil War, let's remember the 600,000 white men 
who died over the issue of slavery.

JEFF
Is that why they died?

JOSH
It's why a lot of them died, Jeff. And there's no other place and time in recorded 
history where an event like that has occurred. So... let's... leave it at that and 
move on.

JEFF
Okay.

JOSH
Except to say this...

JEFF
What?

JOSH
Nothing.

JEFF
What?

JOSH
Let’s move on.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Toby is still happy and passes by. Mandy calls him from inside.

MANDY
Toby.

TOBY
Mandy.

MANDY
You got two seconds?

TOBY
Madeline, you are charming and you are brilliant and for you, I have all the time in 
the world.

MANDY
[to staffers] What's with him?

GINGER
It's the day after his Day of Jubilee.

BONNIE
We've never seen him sustain a good mood this long.

TOBY
Bonnie, you are dedicated and you are beautiful. And Ginger, you are other nice things.

MANDY
Can I see you inside?

TOBY
You bet.

She pushes him into TOBY'S OFFICE. Toby sets his stuff down on the desk.

TOBY
Mandy, I feel like I've lost a hundred and eighty pounds. I'm smiling. I’m laughing. 
I'm enjoying the people I work with. I gotta snap out of this. 
[clears off his leather chair to take a seat] What's on your mind?

MANDY
I want you to help me get the Chinese to give us a new panda bear to replace Lum-Lum.

TOBY
[long pause] Well, that did the trick.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Zoey enters through a door and walks down the hall. She sees Charlie.

ZOEY
Hey.

CHARLIE
Hey, what are you doing here?

ZOEY
C.J. wanted to see me.

CHARLIE
I talked to her, by the way.

ZOEY
Yeah?

CHARLIE
She's said she was going to talk to Danny.

ZOEY
You could have kissed me hello, you know.

CHARLIE
That's what your dorm room is for.

ZOEY
Chicken.

CHARLIE
You'd better believe it. When I kiss you, I want a good two miles between your mouth 
and the Oval Office.

ZOEY
Stacy tells me you're afraid to show me affection in public.

CHARLIE
Tell Stacy to meet me in the middle of Union Station and we'll see how it goes.

ZOEY
Hey Charlie? Does C.J. have a problem?

CHARLIE
Nope.

ZOEY
I wonder what she wants to see me about then?

CHARLIE
I'm not afraid of being affectionate in public. 

Zoey pushes him against the wall and kisses him deeply. He very much responds. Zoey 
walks away, as Charlie smiles.

CHARLIE
See?

Down the hall, Carol greets her.

CAROL
Hi, Zoey. I’ll get her.

Carol knocks and pokes her head in C.J.'S OFFICE.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah.

CAROL
Zoey.

C.J.
Thanks. [puts her papers down]

ZOEY
[comes in] Hey.

C.J.
Hey, Zoey, thanks for stopping by. Carol, can you get the door?

CAROL
Sure.

C.J. walks to the couch as Carol exits and closes the door. Zoey joins C.J. on the couch.

ZOEY
So I'm assuming you heard I talked to a guy.

C.J.
Edgar Drumm.

ZOEY
Yeah. I know I'm supposed to just walk away, but...

C.J.
But he pushed your buttons a little.

ZOEY
David isn't a drug dealer.

C.J.
Did you tell him that you didn't know that David Arbor was going to be at the party?

ZOEY
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay... Zoey, I need to know why you lied to him.

ZOEY
I didn't.

C.J.
And I need to know why you're lying to me right now.

ZOEY
C.J....

C.J.
If you didn't know he was going to be there, why'd you have his car keys with you?

Zoey doesn’t answer.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. SECRET SERVICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Banks of computers and monitors, televisions, and security cameras are around. Agents 
are seated in chairs facing the fronts as Ron Butterfield is heading the meeting.

BUTTERFIELD
...And Mr. Kleeg is being detained for questioning by field agents in Albuquerque. 
Mr. Derrick Horgiboum. Mr. Horgiboum threatened to blow up the Smithsonian unless Zoey 
Bartlet agreed to meet with him for a drink. Mr. Horgiboum is in custody. And the 
Smithsonian remains open for business. Kelly? You had something?

KELLY
The newest sorority pledge stunt is get your picture taken with Zoey.

MIKE
Here's hoping our biggest threat is from the girls of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Some laugh.

BUTTERFIELD
It's not. We're adding some hate groups to the list. The Aryan White Resistance, The 
Christian Defense League, The World Church of the Creator, and Central New York White 
Pride.

MIKE
Sir?

BUTTERFIELD
Mike?

MIKE
The Office of Protective Research says the most recent letters have been signed off 
with the slogan, '14 words'. 

BUTTERFIELD
Who can tell me what 14 words stands for?

GINA
[raises her hand] We must secure the existence of white people and the future for 
white children.

BUTTERFIELD
That’s right. What else do you have, Gina?

GINA
Two death threats were received earlier in the week. One against Zoey, one against 
Charlie. They were made with letters cut from a magazine. And the OPR has identified 
the paper and the typeset as Resistance Magazine.

BUTTERFIELD
This magazine is geared towards recruiting younger people.

GINA
That’s right sir. And the letters have repeatedly used the phrase, "Following the voice 
of blood".

BUTTERFIELD
What is it?

GINA
It's the title of the first record by a band called Graceland. They're very popular 
amongst skinheads. Sir, I'm fairly convinced we're looking for two 15-year-old boys.

BUTTERFIELD
I think you're right. Everyone hit the pictures and see if anyone looks familiar from 
the rope line. Remember it could be anyone. Thank you.

They all get up. A guy comes up to Gina.

GUY
Gina?

GINA
Yeah?

GUY
C.J. Cregg is outside. She'd like to step in.

GINA
Sure.

C.J.
[comes in] Hi.

GINA
Hi, C.J.

C.J.
They told me you were having a briefing. I didn't want to intrude.

GINA
We're done. 

C.J.
I just needed a minute.

GINA
You want some coffee?

C.J.
I'm fine. I just needed to talk to you about the party last night.

GINA
[pours a cup for herself] Okay.

C.J.
Could you describe what, if any, contact Zoey might have had with David Arbor last night?

GINA
No. I'm sorry.

C.J.
I don't understand.

GINA
I'm not permitted to discuss the behavior of my protectee.

C.J.
Zoey's not in trouble.

GINA
I understand.

C.J.
I'm trying to straighten out a discrepancy with what she told me.

GINA
I understand.

C.J.
Gina, I'm the press secretary. There's a story that Zoey's involved with, and I need you 
to tell me what you know about last night.

GINA
I'm sorry, C.J. I can't protect her if she feels she has to do things behind my back. 
I'm not permitted to discuss the behavior of the protectee.

C.J.
Okay, thanks. [starts to leave]

GINA
C.J., the thing with the reporter this morning... it was fast, it was physical. She's 
19 years old and she thought her father was in trouble. 

C.J.
Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry about the...

GINA
No problem.

C.J.
I’ll see you later.

GINA
[sits at her desk] Are you sure you don't want to stay and have some coffee? I'm going 
to stay and look through an FBI photo album of teenage Nazis.

C.J.
Why?

GINA
[smiles] I'm on a break.

C.J.
[smiles] See you later.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
Sam and Mallory are still at it. Only now, they've taken off their suit coats.

SAM
It occurs to me Mallory, that you attended a private primary school, a private high 
school and a private college.

MALLORY
What's your point?

SAM
Well, just that liberals have no problem with rich kids going to expensive private 
schools, that doesn't undermine public education. And liberals have no problem with 
middle-class kids going to parochial schools, that doesn't undermine public education.

MALLORY
Hang on!

SAM
The idea that letting poor public school students choose private alternatives would 
destroy public education is simply contrary to our experience. Boston Latin, the oldest 
public school in America, is still the best secondary school in New England.

MALLORY
Great, but they're not all Boston Latin and Bronx Science, Sam. And since when are the 
liberals the other guys in conversations you have?

There's a knock on the door. C.J. pops in.

C.J.
Excuse me. Hey, Mal.

MALLORY
Hey C.J.

C.J.
[to Sam] You got a second?

SAM
Absolutely. [to Mallory] Excuse me.

SAM goes out into the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

C.J.
Edgar Drumm ambushed Zoey when she was coming out of lunch.

SAM
On campus?

C.J.
Yeah. She said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be there when she did know 
David Arbor was going to be there.

SAM
Why did she lie?

C.J.
Spend all day surrounded by reporters? It starts to become instinct.

SAM
It doesn't sound too bad. Let's just make sure the President doesn't get involved.

C.J.
Yeah... well... when he hears someone tried to talk to her on campus... 

SAM
You're going to have to sit on it.

C.J.
I'm not going to be able to.

SAM
You have to.

C.J.
Sam?

SAM
C.J., you can't back down in front of him. You got to get in his face.

C.J.
Get in the President's face?

SAM
Yeah.

C.J.
That's your advice?

SAM
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay. [turns to others] Does anyone else have any advice... that could... uh...

SAM
C.J., listen to me. It's your job. It's what he needs you to do.

C.J.
Yes.

SAM
Can I ask you something?

C.J.
Sure.

SAM
I would like to see Mallory socially...

C.J. looks into Sam's office and smiles at Mallory.

SAM
But I can't seem to get her past this fight that we're having.

C.J. turns her body so Mallory can't see either of them and picks up a pencil from a desk.

C.J.
Tell her you want to continue the fight over lunch.

SAM
That's good.

C.J.
Yeah.

SAM
That's very good advice.

C.J.
Yeah. It's certainly better advice than "get in the President's face." 

SAM
I'm going to go back into my office.

C.J.
Cool. I'm going to go check the want ads.

SAM
Good luck.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Toby is about at the end of his patience.

TOBY
A panda bear to replace Dim Sum?

MANDY
Lum-Lum.

TOBY
Do you mean Hsing-Hsing?

MANDY
Hsing-Hsing. That was his name. Hsing-Hsing. Yeah. Hsing-Hsing was given to us as a 
gift by the Chinese government when Nixon...

TOBY
I know.

MANDY
Then Hsing-Hsing got lonely, so the Chinese sent a mate over, I think, it’s name 
was Ping.

TOBY
Ling.

MANDY
Ling.

TOBY
It may have been Ping.

MANDY
Whatever. Ping, or Ling, dies. Hsing-Hsing mourns. Panda bears, it turns out, mourn. 
And for Hsing-Hsing, it seemed like the time was unendurable.

TOBY
I know exactly how he felt.

MANDY
Anyway... as you know, Hsing-Hsing succumbed to liver disease and passed away earlier 
this year.

TOBY
Yes.

MANDY
And I was thinking that it would be a good idea as a symbol to signal how serious we 
are about our relationship with China, if... we asked them for another bear.

TOBY
I think it would be a good idea, as a symbol... to signal that China is serious about 
their relationship with us, if they stopped running over their citizens with tanks. 

MANDY
Toby...

TOBY
Mandy! Call the embassy and have them send us over a damn bear. What's the problem?

MANDY
First of all, pandas are very rare. There are maybe a thousand of them and they're 
only in China.

TOBY
We only need one.

MANDY
We need two.

TOBY
Why?

MANDY
Because the other one will get lonely.

TOBY
The other one will get lonely. Well then have them send us two.

MANDY
And second of all, China's not inclined to give us gifts right now.

TOBY
Then get us two regular bears, a bucket of black paint, a bucket of white paint, 
bam, bam, next case.

MANDY
It's hard to believe that the wildlife lobby was nervous about you.

TOBY
I know. I'm Mr. Wildlife.

MANDY
Toby...

TOBY
Mandy! 

They stare at each other.

TOBY
What made you think I'd be interested in this?

MANDY
Josh said you were my man.

TOBY
Josh.

MANDY
Yeah.

TOBY
Said I was your man.

MANDY
Yes.

TOBY
[thinks it over] Oh... I have to say, Mandy... I'm impressed with how much you've grown.

MANDY
What do you mean?

TOBY
Well, there was a time if you got played by Josh like this, you'd want to get back at 
him right away, and it's good to see you rise above that.

MANDY
What do you mean played?

TOBY
He used you to have a little fun with me ‘cause he has to deal with Breckenridge on 
slavery reparations.

MANDY
He played me?

TOBY
Yeah, but it’s good to see you get past that.

MANDY
He played me?

TOBY
Like a two-dollar banjo.

MANDY
[thinks, quietly] Help me.

TOBY
Do what?

MANDY
Cause Josh pain.

TOBY
Hmm... Okay.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is on the phone when Mallory and Sam come in.

MALLORY
Hey, Dad.

LEO
Yeah. [into phone] Hold on, please. 

MALLORY
[barrels on anyway] Dad, I'm sorry, but Sam's asked me to have lunch with him and 
I need your permission.

Leo tells his call to hang on and puts the phone down.

LEO
What do you need my permission to have lunch for?

MALLORY
Sam?

SAM
She says she always asks her father's permission before she has lunch with fascists.

LEO
Oh. Yeah, okay.

MALLORY
He's in favor of school vouchers, Dad.

LEO
No, Mallory. He's really not.

MALLORY
Yes, he is.

LEO
No, he's not.

MALLORY
I read the position paper.

LEO
It's opposition prep.

MALLORY
Opposition prep?

LEO
When we're gearing up for a debate, we have the smart guys take the other side.

MALLORY
[to Sam] You stood there and argued with me.

SAM
Yes.

MALLORY
Why?

SAM
You made an appointment.

MALLORY
Sam...

LEO
Would the two of you take it outside?

SAM
I thought you were trying to drive a wedge between us.

LEO
Yeah, but now you're just boring the crap out of me.

MALLORY
Hey...

SAM
Mallory, education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little 
changes. We need gigantic monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition 
for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. 
School should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to 
its citizens, just like national defense. That’s my position. I just haven't figured 
out how to do it yet.

MALLORY
[softened] You stood there and argued with me.

SAM
And we can continue the argument. But it's lunchtime now. We're going to have lunch.

MALLORY
You're taking over?

SAM
I'm taking over.

MALLORY
Dad?

LEO
Yes, you may go have lunch with the fascist.

MALLORY
Come along, Sam.

MALLORY leaves.

LEO
You're doing fine.

SAM
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is laying on one of the couches reading. Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Sir, you know your lunch with Mr. Girardi got canceled.

BARTLET
I heard. It's the first time anyone's canceled lunch on me since I took office.

CHARLIE
I'm sure Mr. Girardi meant no offense, sir. He was taken to the hospital with pneumonia.

BARTLET
I'm not saying he didn't have a good excuse.

CHARLIE
What are you reading?

BARTLET
Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation by George Washington.

CHARLIE
The George Washington?

BARTLET
The rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims. Washington 
copied them down when he was 14 years old. [reads] "When you sit down, keep your feet 
firm and even, without putting one on the other or crossing them. Put not off your 
clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half-dressed." What a 
tightassed little priss he must've been.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[takes off her glasses and regards Charlie] Do you think I could take George Washington?

CHARLIE
Take him at what, sir?

BARTLET
I don't know... a war?

CHARLIE
Could you have taken George Washington in a war?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Well, you'd have the Air Force and he'd have the Minutemen, right?

BARTLET
The Minutemen were good.

CHARLIE
Still, I think you could probably take him.

BARTLET
Yeah. [winks and puts his glasses back on to read]

CHARLIE
C.J.'s here.

BARTLET
You can send her in.

Charlie leaves and C.J. comes in. 

BARTLET
C.J.

C.J.
Mr. President.

BARTLET
[reads] "When in company, put not your hands on any part of your body not usually 
covered."

C.J.
Well... I do what it takes to keep the press corps happy, Mr. President.

Bartlet puts the book on the coffee table and sits up. C.J. sits on the couch opposite 
the table.

BARTLET
Yeah, you're right. What's going on?

C.J.
Don't blow your stack, all right?

BARTLET
What is going on?

C.J.
Zoey lied to a reporter.

BARTLET
What are you talking about?

C.J.
She was asked should the President's daughter be partying with drug dealers and she 
said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be at the party. Except she did know.

BARTLET
Why did she lie?

C.J.
She didn't have to.

BARTLET
Then why did she?

C.J.
‘Cause sometimes 19 year-old girls lie when they don't have to.

BARTLET
She never has to.

C.J.
She knows that.

BARTLET
Apparently she doesn't.

C.J.
Mr. President... give her a break. This thing's happened to her friend, she doesn't 
know how it affects her father. Edgar Drumm is shouting at her while she comes out 
of class. She choked.

BARTLET
[gets riled] A reporter talked to her on campus?

C.J.
Mr. President...

BARTLET
C.J.!

C.J.
Sir...

BARTLET
[starts to put on his shoes] Put the press in the briefing room. Tell them I'm coming 
right over.

C.J.
No.

BARTLET
C.J....

C.J.
No sir.

BARTLET
We have been over this and we have been over this and we have been over this! They are 
not supposed to talk to my daughter on campus.

C.J.
It was Edgar Drumm.

BARTLET
I don't give a damn if it was the Bergen County Shopper's Guide. I want to talk to the 
press.

C.J.
You can't talk to the press!

BARTLET
Watch me.

C.J.
I'm telling you now, Mr. President, this isn't about your daughter! It's about the first 
daughter and that's my job and you're not going down there! You, me, Charlie and Zoey 
are the only four people who know she was lying and there's no reason it doesn't need 
to stay that way. It's a non-story. You go down there and it's a big story!

Bartlet has his hand on the doorknob and takes a breath. Then turns around.

BARTLET
So I just sit in my office and fume?

C.J.
Yes. And if anybody asks you, you haven't heard anything about it.

BARTLET
Fine.

C.J.
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
What?

C.J.
Did you know he jumped out at Zoey? Gina Toscano put him into a wall?

BARTLET
Excellent.

C.J.
Sir...

BARTLET
I haven't heard anything about it.

C.J.
Very good.

BARTLET
I could take George Washington, by the way.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Anything else?

C.J.
No, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you, C.J.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Jeff and Josh are still in the meeting. Jeff is pacing, Josh is sitting with his feet 
on his desk.

JEFF
How 'bout the Japanese?

JOSH
I knew you were going to bring up the Japanese.

JEFF
We gave 1.2 billion to Japanese-Americans who were in internment camps.

JOSH
They were actually in internment camps. Bring me a living slave and then you've got a case.

JEFF
I think I've got a case without the living slave, but I'm just a civil rights expert, 
so what do I know?

JOSH
Jeff, the committee is going to be looking for a certain degree of practicality. We don't 
have $1.7 trillion. To raise $1.7 trillion, we would have to sell Texas and the U.S. Navy.

JEFF
I understand the predicament and I'm willing to give you a break. We'll take our money 
in tax deductions and scholarship funds, how 'bout that?

JOSH
How about you take it in affirmative action and empowerment zones and civil rights acts?

JEFF
Three things which we wouldn't have needed in the first place.

JOSH
[stands, getting ticked] You know, Jeff... I'd love to give you the money, I really 
would. But I'm a little short of cash right now. It seems the S.S. officer forgot to 
give my grandfather his wallet back when he let him out of Birkenau.

JEFF
Well, your beef’s with the Germans.

JOSH
You're damn right it is! 

Josh pauses and looks at his father’s picture in the wall.

JOSH
What the hell are we talking about?

He sits back down again. So does Jeff.

JEFF
We have laws in this country. You break them, you pay your fine. You break God's laws, 
that's a different story. You can't kidnap a civilization and sell them into slavery. 
No amount of money will make up for it, and all you have to do is look, 200 years later, 
at race relations in this country.

JOSH
Yes.

JEFF
No amount of money will make up for it.

JOSH
Yes.

JEFF
You got a dollar?

JOSH
Yeah.

JEFF
Take it out. Look at the back.

Josh does.

JEFF
The seal, the pyramid, it's unfinished. With the eye of God looking over it. And the 
words Annuit Coeptis. He, God, Favors our Undertaking. The seal is meant to be 
unfinished, because this country's meant to be unfinished. We're meant to keep doing 
better. We're meant to keep discussing and debating and we're meant to read books by 
great historical scholars and then talk about them, which is why I lent my name to a 
dust cover. I want to be your Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I'll do an 
outstanding job for all people in this country. You got any problem with me saying all 
that to the committee?

JOSH
No.

JEFF
Good. You hungry?

JOSH
Yeah.

JEFF
Let me buy you lunch.

JOSH
Yeah, okay. [stands] Hey, Jeff.

JEFF
Yeah.

They put on their coats.

JOSH
There’s going to be a lot of these meetings before your confirmation. Why don't you let 
me get lunch this time, you get it next time?

JEFF
Yeah, okay.

JOSH
Hey Suzanne.

Josh and Jeff walk out the door.

Transcript By: Jo

West Wing S01E19
Rumors percolate about a scathing memo that outlines the weaknesses of President Bartlet's (Martin Sheen) administration for his political rival and grip the White House, until C.J. (Allison Janney) learns it came from one of the trusted staff, Mandy (Moira Kelly). Now in someone else's possession, C.J. finally tracks it down to Danny (Timothy Busfield) and tries to dissuade him from publishing it. Meanwhile, Sam (Rob Lowe) and Toby (Richard Schiff) meet with opposing military officers and congressmen to discuss amending the current "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy towards gays in the armed forces. When two members of the Federal Election Commission resign, Josh (Bradley Whitford) sees opportunity and moves fast to meet with contentious senator's staffers to suggest that the President appoint two campaign finance reformers as replacements instead of those wanted by the Senate leadship. Leo (John Spencer) not only has trouble with the White House's faulty e-mail system, he confronts the President and issues a challenge that could define or destroy his administration.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
MONDAY MORNING
We are shown the open doors to the two offices. Toby is in the left, and Sam is in the 
right. They yell so they can hear each other.

TOBY
Is it gonna rain?

SAM
No.

TOBY
It looks like it’s gonna rain.

SAM
It’s overcast.

TOBY
Isn’t that usually what it is before it rains?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
But in this case?

SAM
It’s not gonna rain till later today.

TOBY
If it rains, please remember to change the opening line.

SAM
It’s not gonna rain till one, maybe two o’clock.

TOBY
Yeah, but if you’re wrong, you gotta change the opening line!

Sam goes into TOBY’S OFFICE.

SAM
I’m not getting this from morning drive-time radio, Toby. I’m getting this from First 
Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau of the U.S. Coast Guard, who would not let me down ‘cause 
she has a very really...a very comforting voice.

TOBY
Okay, here’s my thing. If you’re wrong, if the coast guard is wrong, the remarks open 
with “As I look out over this magnificent vista.” If the event gets moved indoors, he 
will no longer be looking out over a vista of any kind.

SAM
Do you honestly think he can’t change that on his feet? Do you honestly think the 
President doesn’t know where he is when he’s giving a speech?

TOBY
This isn’t a major policy address, Sam. This is five minutes in front of the United 
Organization of Trout Fishermen. I’m saying if it gets moved inside.

SAM
I got this from the U.S. Coast Guard. I got this from the National Weather Service. 
They use satellites. They use technology.

Behind Toby, outside the window, lightning flashes. Thunder claps. It started to rain.

TOBY
This is the same satellite technology we use to detect intercontinental ballistic 
missiles, right?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
All right then.

Toby and Sam head out the office. They meet C.J. outside. 

C.J.
We should move the thing inside.

TOBY
Sam says it’s probably not gonna rain till later.

C.J.
Have either of you heard anything about a piece of paper that’s going around?

SAM
What piece of paper?

They all walk out into the HALLWAY.

C.J.
I don’t know. At the Gaggle, Dave Trillin asked what I knew about a piece of paper 
that’s going around. Maybe you used from the campaign.

SAM
I haven’t heard anything.

C.J.
Me either.

TOBY
Let’s find out.

C.J.
That’s good advice, Toby.

Cutting into a CORRIDOR. They meet Leo.

LEO
We’re in the second floor auditorium in the O.E.O.B.

C.J.
And they’re moving people inside?

LEO
People are there. They moved them twenty minutes ago.

SAM
Why?

LEO
The weather report said it was gonna rain.

SAM
It did?

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
Is it possible First Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau is yanking me around?

TOBY
Where’s the President?

LEO
He’s already over there.

They walk out to the LOBBY.

C.J.
How’s his mood today?

LEO
We had breakfast. He seemed very upbeat, very energetic, very optimistic about the day.

C.J.
How long do you think do you suppose that’s gonna last?

Leo, Sam, Toby and C.J. head out of the White House into the rain.

CUT TO: INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
President Bartlet, Mrs. Landingham, Charlie, Nancy are riding the escalator to the 
second floor of the O.E.O.B. Secret Service Agents surround them.

BARTLET
Can we get this Godforsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a 
civilization gone to hell in a handcart?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Nice talk for a President.

BARTLET
Leave me alone.

They reach the second floor.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know what this is, don’t you sir?

BARTLET
What what is?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Your mood, sir.

BARTLET
There’s nothing wrong with my mood.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It’s your diet.

BARTLET
Would you get off me with that?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You’re not getting enough roughage in your diet. You know I’m right about that.

BARTLET
I know I’d like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. I know that for damn sure.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Once again, you display an immaturity about vegetables and I think is not at all 
Presidential.

BARTLET
Charlie, does anyone have my remarks?

CHARLIE
Sam’s bringing them, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Is Toby on his way?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
C.J.?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Why aren’t they here right now?

CHARLIE
They didn’t know that it was raining, sir.

BARTLET
Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best and the brightest, Charlie.

Cutting through the hallway, they pass an entrance. The President meets with the rest 
of his staff: Toby, C.J., Sam and Leo. They just came from the pouring rain. Everyone 
continues to walk.

TOBY
Good morning, sir.

C.J.
Good morning, Mr. President.

SAM
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Hello.

TOBY
How are you, sir?

BARTLET
You didn’t know it was raining?

TOBY
To our credit sir, we knew it was raining once it started to rain.

BARTLET
Okay.

SAM
Here are your remarks, sir.

BARTLET
A couple of things, uh, who am I gonna be talking to now?

SAM
The United Organization of Trout Fishermen.

BARTLET
No, seriously now.

SAM
Sir?

BARTLET
Give me the damn speech.

SAM
There’s some very nice anecdotes there about trout fishing.

BARTLET
Have I ever been trout fishing?

SAM
Probably not.

BARTLET
Okay.

JOSH
[comes from behind] Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What’s going on Josh?

JOSH
The C.V.O.’s gonna revise its outyear projections, two commissioners resigned from the 
F.E.C. this morning, and the N.G.A. endorsed trigger locks.

TOBY
How much?

JOSH
The projections?

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Uh, maybe 200 billion?

BARTLET
Hang on.

Everyone stops walking near the entrance to the auditorium.

BARTLET
Two F.E.C. commissioners resigned?

JOSH
Yes sir.

BARTLET
There are two seats open in the F.E.C.?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Sir?

BARTLET
This is interesting.

LEO
Sir, this is not the world’s best time to go off on a flight of idealistic-

BARTLET
Leo, two seats just opened up in the Federal Election Commission.

LEO
And the Senate Leadership will fill them.

BARTLET
I’m saying, what if this time we say we want our guys?

LEO
We won’t win.

BARTLET
Yeah, but we can dangle our feet in the water.

LEO
It’s not a good idea, sir.

BARTLET
Josh-

LEO
Mr. President, you’re thinking about changing the nature of democracy.

BARTLET
I’m talking about dangling our feet in the water. Josh, get Leo two candidates who back 
aggressive campaign finance reform.

JOSH
Sir, I-I got to stand with Leo on this. I think that-

BARTLET
I’m not saying jump off the boat, Josh. I’m saying dangle our feet.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

Nancy is waiting in front of the entrance to the auditorium.

NANCY
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yes. Somebody?

SAM
The United Organization of Trout Fishermen.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Bartlet and his staff head for the auditorium.

LEO
You gonna concentrate on this now, or is your head gonna be in changing the nature of 
democracy?

BARTLET
No, I’m definitely gonna be thinking about the trout fishermen, Leo, ‘cause that’s 
where my focus should be.

LEO
You were in a better mood an hour ago, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I was in a better mood a year ago, Leo.

C.J.
[to Leo and Josh] Does anybody know anything about a piece of paper that’s been going 
around?

LEO
What piece of paper?

C.J.
I don’t know.

BARTLET
C.J., are you taller than you usually are?

C.J.
Yes sir. I’m my usual height.

LEO
Okay.

NANCY
Here we go.

BARTLET
Couldn’t pick a trout out of a police lineup, by the way.

LEO
Focus.

Bartlet goes inside the auditorium with Nancy, Charlie and C.J. The rest of the staff 
stays outside. 

HERALD [OS]
Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States!

JOSH
Two Federal Election seats open on the same day?

LEO
You can dream all you want Josh, but you’re dead in the water, it’s never gonna happen.

JOSH
That’s what I thought too, but after your little pep talk just now...

We hear Bartlet inside the auditorium. The staff stands watch by the door.

BARTLET [OS]
Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s good to see you. Thank you.

Toby and Sam just realized something.

TOBY
Sam?

SAM
Damn it!

LEO
What?

SAM
I forgot to do something.

BARTLET [OS]
As I look out over this magnificent vista...

Toby looks away in frustration as Sam slams his notebook.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Josh and Donna are walking.

DONNA
How does the F.E.C. work?

JOSH
Six commissioners are appointed for a six-year term.

DONNA
Overlaps.

JOSH
Two seats come up every two years.

DONNA
And two commissioners just resigned?

JOSH
At the same time.

DONNA
How many times has that happened?

JOSH
Including this time?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Once.

DONNA
So the President has the opportunity to back the F.E.C. without people and make 
immeasurable impact on campaign finance reform?

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Well, do it baby!

JOSH
There’s a couple of roadblocks.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
Whenever a vacancy comes up, the party leadership of both sides... [pause] Did you just 
call me “baby” back there?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Okay. Uh, when a vacancy comes up, it’s up to the President to fill it, but the party 
leadership on both sides always, always, always dictates to the President who he’s gonna 
appoint. One Republican. One Democrat. Whoever the leadership says. That’s how you keep 
the peace.

DONNA
But you’re gonna change all that, right?

JOSH
No, but I’m gonna spend the rest of the week trying.

DONNA
That’s not the right spirit, Josh. You’re trying to change the nature of democracy.

JOSH
You’re right. I’m gonna need a bagel. [goes into his office]

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is giving a briefing.

C.J.
The Easter egg hunt and the Easter egg roll are two different things. The theme of this 
year’s event is “Learning is delightful and delicious,” as, by the way, am I.

The reporters laugh.

C.J.
The collection, which is gonna be on display on the east colonnade to the White House, 
features real chicken eggs decorated by artists from each of the 50 states and the 
district. And the activities are coordinated by the American Egg Board. And I’ve hung 
with some of the cats from the American Egg Board, and they are party people. 
Thank you. That’s it for this afternoon.

As the reporters get ready to leave, C.J. leaves the podium and goes to Steve.

C.J.
Steve?

STEVE
Yeah?

C.J.
You got a second?

STEVE
Sure.

C.J.
What have you heard about a piece of paper that’s out there?

STEVE
Same thing you’ve heard.

C.J.
What’s that?

STEVE
There’s a piece of paper out there.

C.J.
That’s it?

STEVE
Yeah.

C.J.
If you hear anything more, you’ll tell me first?

STEVE
If I find anything more, I’ll tell my editor first.

C.J.
I keep forgetting you don’t work for me.

STEVE
Yes, you do.

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J.
See ya.

STEVE
Bye.

Steve leaves. C.J. faces Mandy.

C.J.
Mandy, there’s a buzz in the room. Something about a piece-

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
Do you know anything about it?

MANDY
I know everything about it.

C.J.
What do you mean?

MANDY
I wrote it.

C.J.
What is it we’re uh...

MANDY
I wrote a memo when I was working for Russell outlining strategies-

Mandy quickly looks away as Katie comes from behind C.J.

KATIE
Excuse me, C.J.?

C.J.
Katie, they’re in the blue room.

KATIE
Thanks. [leaves]

MANDY
When I was working for Russell, I wrote a memo outlining the weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities of the Bartlet administration and mapping out a strategy to defeat 
him for renomination. [pause] C.J. this is embarrassing and a little mortifying, but 
you got to remember how pissed off I was at you guys.

C.J.
You worked for us for a year and a half, and you work for us again now...

MANDY
C.J....

C.J.
...And in between, you wrote a playbook on how to beat us?

MANDY
I was working for Russell, and the whole idea is to-

C.J.
I need to see a copy of it right now!

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J. storms out of the briefing room and slams the door.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is in front of his computer.

LEO
[calls] Margaret!

MARGARET
[comes in] Yes?

LEO
I can’t e-mail.

MARGARET
They’re working on the problem.

LEO
What’s the problem?

MARGARET
My friend, Lynette, from the President’s Council on Physical Fitness, you remember her?

LEO
[irritated] No.

MARGARET
She’s the one where you say, “Who’s that?” And I say, “That’s my friend, Lynette, from 
the President’s Council on Physical Fitness.”

JOSH
Hey.

LEO
Oh, hey Josh.

MARGARET
Anyway, she sent me an e-mail about the actual calorie count in the raisin muffin 
they’re serving in the mess. I forwarded the e-mail to several hundred assistants 
and secretaries in O.E.O.B. and in the West Wing, and that was fine. But Jolene 
Millman, who works in political liaison, then hit reply, which apparently-

LEO
Oh Margaret! Margaret! I’m sorry. I’m gonna have to...I hung in there as long as I 
could, but you long since passed the point when I stopped caring. If you’re curious, 
it was right around raisin muffin.

MARGARET
I’ll leave you two alone.

LEO
And fix the e-mail.

MARGARET
Yes. [leaves]

LEO
So, who’d you come up with?

JOSH
John Bacon and Patricia Calhoun.

LEO
Oh, I know John Bacon. Who’s the other?

JOSH
Patty Calhoun’s the director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the 
Heritage Foundation. She worked in the White House O.M.B. under two Republican Presidents.

LEO
And she favors campaign finance overhaul?

JOSH
Aggressive overhaul.

LEO
Then the leadership’s gonna hate them both.

JOSH
What do you want me to do?

LEO
Meet with the top guys in the leadership offices.

JOSH
You want me to meet with the leadership?

LEO
Absolutely not. I want you to meet their guys, and I want you to do it outside the 
building. Do it over a meal.

JOSH
Leo, the President can’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?

LEO
Hmmm?

JOSH
The President doesn’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?

LEO
No.

JOSH
Okay.

JOSH
What happened with e-mail?

LEO
Oh, I don’t know. It has something to do with the President’s Council on Physical Fitness.

JOSH
Okay.

Josh leaves. Leo looks swiftly.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Josh comes out of Leo’s office. Sam and Toby see him.

SAM
Hey.

TOBY
Who’d you come up with?

JOSH
John Bacon and Patty Calhoun.

SAM
Not in a million years.

JOSH
Tell me something else I should know. What are you doing?

TOBY
It’s our turn with the boys.

JOSH
Knock ‘em dead.

SAM
Hey, listen.

TOBY
Yeah?

SAM
You want me to do the talking when we get in there?

TOBY
Why?

SAM
Just asking.

Toby opens the door to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Toby and Sam meet with several majors and 
congressmen in the room. MAJOR TATE, MAJOR THOMPSON, and two Congressmen, KEN and MIKE, 
are seated around the table.

TOBY
Good morning. Good morning. We all know each other. Why don’t we sit down? We’ve been 
conducting meetings with various senior staff on the D.O.D., N.S.C. and House and 
Senate Armed Services. We feel a little hamstrung because of the policy inherited 
regarding gays and lesbians in the military. And we’d like as much reform input as 
possible before making a recommendation to the President.

MAJOR THOMPSON
Toby, can I interrupt you for a moment?

TOBY
Sure.

MAJOR THOMPSON
What do you imagine’d be the consequence of your recommendation to the President?

TOBY
Well, actually, it’ll be Sam’s recommendation to the President. It’s on his desk, and 
I’m just helping out.

MAJOR THOMPSON
Sam, what do you imagine’d be the consequence?

SAM
Major, bearing in mind that the President seldom, if ever, listens to my recommendation, 
I’d imagine the consequence to be little.

KEN
I would imagine it to be very little, Sam.

SAM
Congressman, the commander-in-chief orders that gays can serve openly in the military. 
That’s the way it’s gonna be, and anybody who chooses to disobey that order can stand 
court marshal under the uniform code and military justice.

MAJOR TATE
The President can order the joint chiefs and the chiefs can give all the orders they 
want. It takes an act of Congress to amend the uniform code. And the uniform code makes 
sodomy a crime. That’s the end of the story.

TOBY
I guess it’s gonna be a pretty short meeting.

MAJOR TATE
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. comes out of the briefing room. Donna follows.

DONNA
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DONNA
There will be 25,000 wooden eggs in addition to the 7,500 other eggs.

C.J.
What are the other eggs made out of?

DONNA
Ah... the other eggs are...

C.J.
They’re actually eggs.

DONNA
Yeah. Mandy’s in your office.

C.J.
What is Josh doing?

DONNA
F.E.C. commissioners.

C.J.
Would you tell him when he has a free moment I’d like to see him?

DONNA
Yeah.

Donna goes the other way. C.J. meets Carol in her desk.

C.J.
Carol, 25,000 wooden eggs.

CAROL
In addition to the 7,500 eggs that are...

C.J.
They’re just regular eggs.

CAROL
Okay.

C.J.’S OFFICE. C.J. sees Mandy, carrying an envelope. 

C.J.
Is that it?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
Who has it?

MANDY
I don’t know.

C.J.
But somebody does.

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay. I’m gonna read it now.

MANDY
Should I...?

C.J.
Go back to your office, and don’t answer any questions.

MANDY
You’ll...call me when you’re done reading?

C.J.
I’d count on it.

Mandy leaves. C.J. starts reading.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. CAPITOL HILL ROOM - DAY
Josh is meeting with the STEVE ONORATO, and other aides from the Leadership office. 
They are in the middle of a meal.

JOSH
Soft money contributions render the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless. Soft money 
contributions, which were ostensibly designed for party-building, whatever that might 
mean, do nothing but eviscerate any meaningful election controls. We are, by definition, 
corrupt.

STEVE
I wouldn’t say that.

JOSH
I know you wouldn’t, Steve. This money isn’t coming in in 5’s and 10’s and 20’s. It’s 
coming in in denominations of 100, 200, 500 thousand dollars. It’s coming from special 
interests. It’s coming from special interests whose interests aren’t the same as those 
who don’t have a half a million bucks lying around, and it’s not going to party-building. 
It’s going to issue ads. It’s going to candidates.

MAN
Yeah. It’s called free speech, Josh.

JOSH
If the insurance company wants to buy ad time from 64 major markets, they are free to do 
so. If the airplane manufacturing industry wants to back a candidate, they are free to 
shout from the rooftops. If big tobacco wants to wave a sign or put a bumper sticker on 
their cars, they are free to do so. That’s free speech. Money isn’t speech.

JERRY
I like it when Josh comes here once in a while to teach us a lesson we so richly deserve.

JOSH
I came here as a courtesy, Jerry. I came at the request of Leo McGarry. The President is 
strong considering... John Branford Bacon and Patty Calhoun to fill in the two seats.

STEVE
I’m pretty sure we’ve already got our two guys, don’t we?

MAN
Yes.

JERRY
It’s Grant Kalen. 

STEVE
Grant Kalen and Joe Barkley.

JOSH
Two people who oppose any campaign finance reform. Well...

JERRY
I thought you like Kalen, Josh. He got a lot of democrats elected in Indiana.

JOSH
He raised a lot of money in Indiana. And Joe Barkley says that people are allowed to 
spend whatever they want in politics.

STEVE
Yeah. So does the Supreme Court, by the way. Uh, Josh, look, we can’t have this meeting 
every time the President wakes up in the morning and decides to make the world better. 
The party leadership’s gonna choose a Republican. The party leadership’s gonna choose a 
Democrat. That’s the way it’s always been. That’s the way it’s gonna be. That’s the way 
it is. 

JOSH
Really?

STEVE
Yes.

JOSH
The President makes appointments to the Federal Election Commission.

STEVE
And the Senate confirms them. And I’m speaking from the majority leader. Embarrass us 
like this, and we will give the same back to you tenfold. Every piece of legislation the 
White House wants off the table will make a sudden appearance.

MAN
Yeah. Steve’s talking our greatest hits, Josh. 5-4-1, school prayer, Family Support Act, 
Entertainment Decency Act.

JERRY
English as the national language.

STEVE
English as the national language will be first up. That’s gonna be our leadoff hitter.

JOSH
Wouldn’t it be easier to just not confirm our nominees?

STEVE
Oh, we’re gonna do that too.

JOSH
Are you saying that in addition to voting down our nominees, there’s gonna be political 
retribution for having nominated them in the first place?

STEVE
Yes. You know why? Because you know if you do this, you’re gonna lose, and we’re gonna 
look bad winning. I also got to say that I reject the suggestion that the best way to 
maintain free speech is by having government regulate it.

JOSH
[quietly] Reject whatever you want.

STEVE
I-I didn’t hear that.

JOSH
I said reject whatever you want! You know, four hours ago, this was a fool’s errand for 
me, and the President knew it. This was a test balloon. This was a “just out of curiosity 
let’s see what would happen if” meeting, but you’ve managed to get me on board.

MAN
Steve, we got a caucus.

STEVE
We got to go.

They all leave the room. Josh sits still.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Mrs. Landingham comes out of her office. Charlie follows.

CHARLIE
Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I’m going to lunch, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Speaking of lunch.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah?

CHARLIE
The President’s not too wild about his.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What’s the nature of his dissatisfaction?

CHARLIE
He said it’s made almost entirely of vegetables.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It’s a salad, Charlie.

CHARLIE
The President’d prefer a sandwich. He says roast beef would be fine. Pastrami, sliced 
steak...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Charlie, tell the President he will eat his salad. If he doesn’t like it, he knows where 
to put his salad.

CHARLIE
Well, I don’t think I will tell the President that, Mrs. Landingham, but I appreciate 
your help.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You bet.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
The meeting continues.

MIKE
It ain’t broke, don’ fix it, Sam. 

SAM
Officer...

MIKE
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” works.

SAM
No, it doesn’t.

MIKE
Yes, it does.

SAM
Do you like to know how much it doesn’t? Eleven hundred and forty-five were discharged 
from being gay in 1998. 

TOBY
That’s a record.

SAM
It’s a 92% increase since “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was implemented. 414 Air Force 
discharges--the highest in two decades. 271 of them during basic training at Lackland 
Air Force Base. 271 during basic training.

TOBY
Major, what the hell is going on at Lackland Air Force Base?

MAJOR TATE
I don’t like your sense of humor.

TOBY
I get that a lot.

C.J.
[comes in] Excuse me. I’m sorry. I need Toby.

TOBY
Yeah. [to Sam] Come here a sec.

Toby and Sam go to the door. Toby whispers to Sam.

TOBY
You’re doing good. [to C.J.] What?

Toby goes out into the CORRIDOR.

C.J.
I know what the piece of paper is.

TOBY
What is it?

C.J.
It’s a recon-and-strategy memo that Mandy wrote when she was working for Russell.

TOBY
Strategy to do what?

C.J.
Beat us in three years.

TOBY
Did you read it?

C.J.
Yeah.

TOBY
Is it bad?

C.J.
Yeah.

TOBY
Let’s go to my office.

C.J. and Toby walk away.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Josh comes in the White House. Donna is standing in the middle waiting for him.

DONNA
How’d it go?

JOSH
[surprised] How do you know to be standing here?

DONNA
I see you at the window.

JOSH
You don’t have a window.

DONNA
You have a window.

JOSH
What are you doing in my office when I’m not there?

DONNA
Looking for you at the window.

JOSH
Okay.

They walk off.

DONNA
How’d it go?

JOSH
It went fine.

DONNA
Just fine?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
You don’t want to say anything more than that?

JOSH
I don’t, Donna, and the way that you know that I don’t, is that I’m not.

DONNA
But this is our special time together.

JOSH
I’m really not in the mood to mess around.

DONNA
Okay.

JOSH
I need you to get me prepped on something.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
English as the national language.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
Might come up.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
Because...it doesn’t matter. Because if we do a thing with the F.E.C., opponents will 
put English as the national language on the table.

DONNA
Are we for it or against it?

JOSH
Donna...

DONNA
I mean we’re not in favor of making another language the official language, are we?

JOSH
Donna!

DONNA
Like Dutch of something.

JOSH
Donna, didn’t I just say that I can’t mess around?

DONNA
Okay.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Bullet points?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Give me thirty minutes?

JOSH
Thank you. [goes into his office]

DONNA
Oh, and Toby said to come by as soon as you got back.

JOSH
Toby?

DONNA
Yeah.

Josh hurries out.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. watches as Toby reads. Ginger knocks and pokes her head in.

GINGER
Toby.

TOBY
I’m not taking any calls right now, Ginger.

GINGER
It’s-

TOBY
I’ll call him back.

Ginger closes the door and walks back to her desk.

TOBY
[reads] “The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes. An agenda 
hopelessly stalled and lacking a coherent strategy. An administration plagued by 
indecision...”

Someone knocks.

TOBY
Ginger!

JOSH
[comes in and closes the door] What’s going on?

C.J.
Mandy wrote an instruction manual for Russell, and it’s out there somewhere.

JOSH
Where?

C.J.
I don’t know yet.

JOSH
How bad is it?

C.J.
Well, she takes the three of us to town. We don’t look like rocket scientists. But, 
then again, we’re not rocket scientists.

JOSH
Who is it bad for?

TOBY
The President... Leo. The President and Leo.

JOSH
We don’t know who has this?

C.J.
I’m talking to everybody in the room.

JOSH
Do it quietly.

TOBY
And quickly. Whose paper will it be in tomorrow? We have to know right away.

C.J.
Yeah.

C.J. leaves. Josh sits beside Toby.

JOSH
Our second year doesn’t seem to be going a whole lot better than our first, does it?

TOBY
No.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby comes in. Leo’s office door is closed. He approaches Margaret, who’s in front of 
her computer.

TOBY
Margaret, does he have a minute?

MARGARET
He’s finishing up with the chairman.

TOBY
They almost done?

MARGARET
Yeah.

TOBY
I’ll wait.

MARGARET
You having problems with your e-mail?

TOBY
Yeah.

MARGARET
Technical support says the pipeline’s been flooded. Apparently it happened when I 
forwarded an e-mail to several people, and one of them tried to reply. Everyone’s 
e-mail box is clogged with replies, which are now, automatically and constantly 
bounding back and forth at subatomic speed... 
[pause] I passed the where you’re interested, haven’t I?

TOBY
Yeah.

Leo’s door opens. Out comes Admiral Fitzwallace and another officer.

LEO
Thank you, Fitz.

FITZWALLACE
Thank you. Hey Toby.

TOBY
Good afternoon admiral.

LEO
Toby, you here to see me?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Fitz, the President’s gonna want to know is the Philippines redundant, that’s all.

FITZWALLACE
It is redundant. That’s the beauty of it.

LEO
Well, you’re gonna have to convince the President of its beauty.

FITZWALLACE
Yeah. I will.

LEO
If you say so.

FITZWALLACE
[to Toby] Say, who are those guys across the hall?

TOBY
They’re meeting with Sam on gays in the military.

FITZWALLACE
Why?

TOBY
Sam’s trying to put together a coherent position.

FITZWALLACE
When he comes up with one, let me know, will ya?

TOBY
Yes, sir. By the way, there may be a major security breach with the White House computers.

FITZWALLACE
White House computers aren’t secure.

TOBY
Well... that explains that.

Margaret looks as Fitzwallace leaves. Toby goes into LEO’S OFFICE. Leo walks behind his 
desk. 

LEO
He wants to put A1/M1s in Manila.

TOBY
The President’s gonna say it’s redundant.

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY
How much does it cost?

LEO
Not much. Twenty billion.

TOBY
So...there’s gonna be a thing.

LEO
About what?

TOBY
Mandy wrote an opposition research memo for Russell, and somebody’s got it.

LEO
Who?

TOBY
C.J.’s finding out.

LEO
Well, it’s politics, Toby. She was playing for the other guys.

TOBY
Yeah... There’s some observations the President’s not gonna be wild about.

LEO
I move him to the middle?

TOBY
The sense is that his instinct is to be aggressive, and you take him to safe ground.

LEO
Okay.

TOBY
Leo...

LEO
Don’t worry about it.

TOBY
Hey, look...

LEO
Don’t worry about it.

TOBY
Want to see a copy?

LEO
No.

TOBY
Okay... Okay. [looks earnestly at Leo]

CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Josh is walking. Donna comes from behind. She gives him a piece of paper.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
Six pages on English as the national language.

JOSH
Is it good?

DONNA
I gave you some good stuff on James Madison and the-

JOSH
James Madison?

DONNA
And the Teriman resort-

JOSH
I didn’t ask for a damn social studies paper. I-I-

DONNA
[stops walking] Don’t snap at me Josh.

JOSH
Donna?

DONNA
Look at the memo. I gave you what you asked for. Don’t snap at me. [starts walking] 
What’s wrong with everyone today? It’s been all day. Is it Mandy’s memo?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Why is everyone walking around like they know they already lost?

JOSH
I wasn’t snapping at you. I just, I-I didn’t realize that you also gave me the stuff I 
asked for. I thought it was just...you know, I thought you just gave me James Madison.

DONNA
Well, look at the James Madison. It’s gonna help you.

JOSH
Thanks.

JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh walks inside. Mandy is waiting for him.

MANDY
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

MANDY
How is James Madison gonna help you?

JOSH
I really don’t know.

MANDY
I meant that-

JOSH
The President wants to put two reformers on the F.E.C. Onorato says they’ll retaliate 
by opening up English as the national language.

MANDY
The President’s not gonna look good fighting against that one.

JOSH
I’ve been working here 14 months, Mandy. Tell me what else I should know.

MANDY
You should know that the President is not gonna look good fighting against that one.

JOSH
Mandy...

MANDY
You take an opposition to flag-burning amendment, school prayer, and gays in the 
military. You pile on no to English as the national language, and they will paint 
a picture.

JOSH
I understand, Mandy.

MANDY
Fine. I’m just saying that it’s my job to tell you that.

JOSH
You know, today, isn’t really the best day for you to tell me what your job is.

MANDY
I wrote an op memo, Josh. You and I have written 20 of them.

JOSH
You never heard of a burn bag?

MANDY
They got it off my hard disk.

JOSH
You know who has it?

MANDY
No.

JOSH
Then there’s not much you can do for us today.

MANDY
You shouldn’t let the President get into a debate on English as the national-

JOSH
Mandy, it’s not gonna happen. Don’t worry about it. It’s not gonna happen. The 
President’s not gonna nominate who he wants in the F.E.C.

MANDY
Why not?

JOSH
’Cause it’s not what we do.

MANDY
All right. I’ll leave you alone.

JOSH
Thanks.

Mandy leaves. Donna comes in.

JOSH
It’s everyone that’s feeling this way today?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Oh, okay. Thanks.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
The meeting continues without Toby.

MAJOR THOMPSON
Hang on!

SAM
I’m saying-

MAJOR THOMPSON
Hang on. A lot of those cases-

SAM
This report, by the way-

MAJOR TATE
We know the report.

SAM
I’m saying-

MAJOR TATE
We can read. We know the report.

MAJOR THOMPSON
We know the report. A lot of the cases you’re talking about is the gays being discharged, 
came from voluntary statements-

SAM
And a lot of these are not voluntary statements, not by any definition given by any 
civilian court in this country. It is not a voluntary statement when it’s given to a 
psychotherapist, as in the case of former Marine corporal David Blessing. It is not a 
voluntary statement when it’s made into a personal diary, as in the case of former West 
Point cadet Nicole Garrison. It is not when it’s made after being asked, as in the case 
of master chief officer Diane Kelli. And it is not when it is coerced out of a service 
member through fear...through intimidation, through death threats, in terms of criminal 
prosecution, as in the case of former Air Force Major Bob Kiddis, former Marine gunnery 
sergeant Kevin Keys, and four sailors aboard the U.S.S. Essex.

MAJOR
Sam, you take care of your guys; we’ll take care of ours.

SAM
You’re not taking care of your guys. Your guys are out looking for jobs.

MAJOR THOMPSON
Those weren’t our guys.

Admiral Fitzwallace enters.

MAJOR TATE
Oh my God.

MAJOR THOMPSON
Attention!

The officers in the room swiftly stand straight.

FITZWALLACE
Good afternoon, Sam.

SAM
Mr. Chairman.

FITZWALLACE
Congressman.

KEN
How do you do admiral?

FITZWALLACE
Good to meet you again, Ken. [to Mike] We haven’t met.

MIKE
Mike Satchel.

FITZWALLACE
From Oregon?

MIKE
Yes, sir.

FITZWALLACE
Percy Fitzwallace.

MIKE
It’s an honor to meet you, admiral.

FITZWALLACE
I imagine it would be. Yes.

SAM
Uh, Major Tate, Major Thompson, this is Chairman Fitzwallace.

FITZWALLACE
They’re not gonna speak to me until I speak to them, Sam. They’re pretty well-trained.
[to Tate and Thompson] Stand easy, fellas. [sees the snack on the table]
Is this Danish for everybody?

SAM
Oh. Yes sir.

FITZWALLACE
[to Tate and Thompson] We’re discussing gays in the military, huh?

MAJOR THOMPSON
Yes sir.

FITZWALLACE
What do you think?

No response.

FITZWALLACE
I said what do you think?

MAJOR THOMPSON
Sir, we’re here to help the White House form a possible-

FITZWALLACE
I know. I’m asking you what you think.

MAJOR TATE
Sir, we’re not prejudiced toward homosexuals.

FITZWALLACE
You just don’t want to see them serving in the Armed Forces?

MAJOR TATE
No sir, I don’t.

FITZWALLACE
‘Cause they oppose a threat to unit discipline and cohesion.

MAJOR TATE
Yes sir.

FITZWALLACE
That’s what I think too. I also think the military wasn’t designed to be an instrument 
of social change.

MAJOR TATE
Yes sir.

FITZWALLACE
The problem with that is that what they were saying to me 50 years ago. Blacks shouldn’t 
serve with Whites. It would disrupt the unit. You know what? It did disrupt the unit. 
The unit got over it. The unit changed. I’m an admiral in the U.S. Navy and chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...Beat that with a stick. [to Ken] We’ll see you, Ken.
[leaves]

SAM
Excuse me.

Sam leaves and goes into the HALLWAY. He tries to catch up with Fitzwallace.

SAM
Mr. Chairman... Just, thanks for stopping in.

FITZWALLACE
You’re not gonna get anywhere.

SAM
The President just wanted some exploratory meetings.

FITZWALLACE
Yeah.

Fitzwallace walks away. Sam goes back to the room.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
C.J. walks in. She sees Danny typing.

C.J.
Danny.

DANNY
Hey.

C.J.
I was hoping to find you here. I wanted to ask you-

DANNY
Hang on.

C.J.
I wanted to ask you-

DANNY
Hang on.

C.J. waits impatiently behind Danny.

C.J.
Danny, is it the Magna Carta or-?

DANNY
I’m trying to finish a thought here.

C.J.
Go ahead.

DANNY
[pretends to think] I’m finished.

C.J.
Okay. You’ve heard there’s a piece of paper out there, right?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
You know what it is?

DANNY
It’s a strategy memo for Russell?

C.J.
That’s right. [pause] You got to know, I don’t want exploiting our friendship in any 
way, and I certainly don’t like taking advantage of any feelings beyond friendship you 
might have for me.

DANNY
Right. You have them for me too.

C.J.
I don’t.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
I need to be ready for this...Do you know who has it?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Who has it?

DANNY
I do.

C.J.
You have it?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
And you’re gonna write about it?

DANNY
Sure.

C.J.
Why?

DANNY
Look-

C.J.
Why?

DANNY
‘Cause it’s news, C.J.

C.J.
It’s not news.

DANNY
It is.

C.J.
It’s not news just because it’s entertaining, Danny.

DANNY
It’s news ‘cause a media director of a successful Presidential campaign wrote a memo 
to a leader of a President’s party describing his weaknesses. Well, there are other 
people in the President’s party. A lot of them buy my newspaper, and I think they’d 
like to know what Mandy thinks, and I don’t think that’s at all out of line.

C.J.
Mandy wasn’t working for the President at the time she wrote this memo-

DANNY
I don’t care if she’s working for Bask’n Robbins when she wrote this memo. She’s a key 
player in the Democratic Party, and she says the President is staggeringly vulnerable. 
And that may not be good news for you, C.J., but it’s news. [pause] At this morning’s 
briefing, you asked us to write about Easter eggs so I wouldn’t be-

C.J.
Fine.

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
We’ll have a comment for you at the end of the day.

C.J. walks off. Danny follows.

DANNY
[yells] None of this is our fault, C.J.!

C.J.
None of what is your fault?

DANNY
Mandy thought it was a pretty accurate analysis, and you know it. You knew she was 
working for Russell, and you knew why. You knew she had to have written the memo. Why 
wasn’t it the first thing you asked for when you hired her? “Mandy, tell us everything 
you think we’re doing wrong.” ‘Cause you knew what she was gonna say. You knew she was 
right. You knew there was nothing you could do about it. [pause] You guys are stuck in 
the mud, around here, and none of it is the fault of the press. I know you’re frustrated. 
But it ain’t nothing compared to the frustration of the people who voted for you, so 
don’t come in here and question my...“We’ll have a comment for you by the end of the 
day”? When I want the White House to comment on a story of mine, I’ll ask for it, C.J.
[calms down] I got to do this. I have to do this work.

C.J.
Okay.

C.J. walks out the door. Danny goes back to his computer.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

KEN
I’d like to go on record by saying-

SAM
Congressman.

KEN
No. I’d like to go on record-

SAM
There is no record.

KEN
I’d like to go on record saying that I have no objection to what somebody does in the 
privacy of their own home. But when we’re talking about schools, when we’re talking 
about the boy scouts, when we’re talking about an army barracks-

SAM
You know, Ken. There’s something I’d always wanted to ask you. What does being gay mean 
you can’t keep your hands to yourself? Over what kind of gentlemanly pride of the Armed 
Forces willing to lay claim the restraint in that area? You want me to get the file on 
sexual harassment on the D.O.D.? Do you want me to ask these guys about Tailok?

KEN
I’ve had enough of this.

SAM
And I’ve had more than enough of this!

KEN
Sam, don’t ask, don’t tell, don’t pursue is the law. It’s federal law, and it takes an 
act of Congress to change it. If the President were serious about changing it, he’d be 
serious about changing it. He would not send you in here with me. He would not send you 
in here with two relatively junior D.O.D. staffers. He’d call his staff together, he’d 
say, “I want a resolution in the House. I want 50 high-profile co-sponsors. I want a 
deal, and I want it now.” Has the President done that?

SAM
The President’s veracity on this-

KEN
Has the President done that, Sam?

SAM
No.

KEN
Okay then... Is this meeting anything more than a waste of time?

SAM
No.

KEN
Okay then.

Everyone leaves. Sam sits still.

CUT TO: INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby, while waiting for Leo, is talking to Margaret.

MARGARET
I.T. support is now accusing me of being a hacker. They’re accusing me of spamming or 
smurfing. They asked me if I was running a Trojan horse. I said no, I...I was simply 
informing the others that the calorie count in the raisin muffin was wrong. And it is, 
Toby. You don’t believe me...You should take one of those muffins and you know, take it 
down to the lab.

TOBY
I’ll do that.

MARGARET
Will you?

TOBY
Get me a muffin. Be careful not to handle it yourself. You want to use gloves. Slip it 
to me in a plastic bag. I’ll send it off to the lab.

MARGARET
You’re mocking me now, aren’t you?

TOBY
Yes.

Leo’s office door opens.

LEO
Come in.

Toby comes in LEO'S OFFICE. Leo walks to sit.

LEO
Margaret thinks the F.B.I.’s gonna bust in here any minute.

TOBY
Yeah.

TOBY
I got my second bit of bad news for you today, Leo.

LEO
You got new numbers?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
How bad is it?

TOBY
CNN/USA Today puts our job approval at 42%.

LEO
We dropped five points?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
In a week?

TOBY
His unfavorables are higher than his favorables for the first time. Fifty-four percent 
of the country is likely to vote for a Republican Congressional candidate in November.

LEO
We dropped five points in a week?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
We didn’t do anything last week.

TOBY
I’ll say.

LEO
Toby, when you start thinking about jumping ship, you’ll let me know, right?

TOBY
One victory in a year, Leo.

LEO
Toby-

TOBY
Mendoza. We got Mendoza on the Court.

LEO
This President was elected with 48% of the vote, Toby.

TOBY
Yeah, but he was elected.

LEO
Without a mandate. The majority of people in the country voted for somebody else.

TOBY
I don’t care, Leo. He was elected. He was sworn in. I was standing ten feet from the 
chief justice.

LEO
I’m saying it’s not the easiest circumstance on...

TOBY
Who the hell said it would be easy?

LEO
... One victory in a year isn’t so bad!

TOBY
One victory in a year stinks in a life of an administration. But it’s not the ones we 
lose that bother me, Leo. It’s the ones we don’t suit up for! 
[pause] And I’m not too crazy about you questioning my loyalty just then.

Someone knocks.

LEO
Yeah?

C.J.
[comes in] Hey.

LEO
Oh. Hey C.J.

C.J.
The President’s reading Mandy’s memo. I just gave it to him.

LEO
I wish you hadn’t done that, C.J.

C.J.
Why?

LEO
It’s just gonna piss him off.

C.J.
It’s gonna be in the newspapers tomorrow.

LEO
Did you find out who has it?

C.J.
Danny.

LEO
And he’s writing it?

C.J.
Yeah. It should run right next to the new polling numbers.

Josh and Sam come in from the other door.

JOSH
How did we drop five points in a week?

LEO
It happened. Let’s move on.

JOSH
What I think is, the Senate will confirm Bacon and Calhoun. They’ll have to ‘cause 
their credentials are too good, and the voters want campaign reform. As a punishment, 
they’ll roll out a legislative agenda designed to force the President to come down on 
the unpopular side of everything. For instance, they’ll bring out English as the 
national language. I believe-

LEO
We’re not gonna let it on the table.

JOSH
I think we shouldn’t be afraid-

LEO
Josh!

JOSH
Leo, I think we shouldn’t be afraid to get into it on English as the-

LEO
He’s not gonna let it on the table.

JOSH
Then we’ll live with their candidates for the F.E.C.

LEO
As we always have.

JOSH
Yes.

LEO
[to Sam] What about you?

SAM
My meeting?

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
It was the same meeting we’ve been having for... [beat] It was fine.

Everyone’s faces are covered with sadness. 
Charlie knocks and walks in from the Oval Office.

LEO
Yeah?

CHARLIE
I’m sorry to interrupt. [points to the Oval Office]

LEO
Yeah.

Leo stands and goes into THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet is seated in a chair, with memo in 
his hand. Leo comes in. Charlie closes the door and stays there.

BARTLET
Who’s got this?

LEO
Danny Concannon.

BARTLET
Why am I just finding out about this now?

LEO
We spent most of the day learning about it ourselves.

BARTLET
I really did wake up energized this morning.

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
I never go to bed that way.

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
Just once, in this job, I’d like to end a day feeling as good as I did when the day 
started. [pause] Are you bothered by this?

LEO
The memo?

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Yes.

BARTLET
We’ve heard it all before, Leo. You drive me to political safe ground. It’s not true.

LEO
I know it’s not true.

BARTLET
Good. [heads for his desk]

LEO
You drive me there.

BARTLET
[turns] What the hell did you say?

LEO
And you know it too.

BARTLET
Leo?

LEO
We’re stuck in neutral because that’s where you tell me to stay.

BARTLET
You’re wrong.

LEO
No. I’m not, sir.

BARTLET
You want to do this now?

LEO
Sir?

BARTLET
You came to my house, Leo.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
You came to my house, and you said, “Jed, let’s run for President.” I said, “Why?” 
And you said, “So that you can open your mouth and say what you think!” Where’d that 
part go, Leo?

LEO
You tell me, Mr. President. I don’t see a shortage of cameras or microphones around 
here. What the hell were you waiting for?

BARTLET
Look...

LEO
Everything you do...

BARTLET
This morning-

LEO
Everything you do says: “For God’s sakes, Leo. I don’t want to be a one-term President.”

BARTLET
Did I not say put our guys on the F.E.C.?

LEO
No sir. You did not do that.

BARTLET
Leo!

LEO
You said -- No! You said, let’s dangle our feet in the water of whatever the hell it is 
we dangle our feet in, when we want to make it look like we’re trying without pissing 
too many people off!

BARTLET
You’re writing a fascinating version of history, my friend.

LEO
Oh, take a look at Mandy’s memo, Mr. President, and you’ll read a fascinating version 
of it.

BARTLET
You brought me in on teachers. You brought me in on capital gains. You brought me in 
on China. And you brought me in on guns.

LEO
Brought you in from where? You’ve never been out there on guns. You’ve never been out 
there on teachers. You dangle your feet, and I’m the hall monitor around here. It’s my 
job to make sure nobody runs too fast or goes off too far. I tell Josh to go to the Hill 
on campaign finance, he knows nothing’s gonna come out of it.

BARTLET
That’s crap.

LEO
Sam can’t get real on Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell because you’re not gonna be there, and every 
guy sitting across the room from him knows that.

BARTLET
Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military, 
you would tell me, “Don’t run too fast or go to far.”

LEO
If you ever told me to get aggressive about anything, I’d say I serve at the pleasure of 
the President. [pause] But we’ll never know, sir, because I don’t think you’re ever gonna 
say it.

BARTLET
I have said it, and nothing’s every happened!

LEO
You want to see me orchestrate this right now? You want to see me mobilize these people? 
These people who would walk into fire if you told them to. These people who showed up to 
lead. These people who showed up to fight. [points at Charlie] That guy gets death 
threats because he’s black and he dates your daughter. He was warned: “Do not show up 
to this place. You’re life will be in danger.” He said, “To hell with that, I’m going 
anyway.” You said, “No.” Prudent, or not prudent, this 21 year old for 600 dollars a 
week says, “I’m going where I want to because a man stands up.”
[pause] Everyone’s waiting for you. I don’t know how much longer.

BARTLET
I don’t want to feel like this anymore.

LEO
You don’t have to.

BARTLET
I don’t want to go to sleep like this.

LEO
You don’t have to.

BARTLET
I want to speak.

LEO
Say it out loud. Say it to me.

BARTLET
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.

LEO
Say it again.

BARTLET
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.

LEO
Now we’re in business!

Leo goes to the table and picks up a pen and writes on a pad.

BARTLET
What’s happening?

LEO
We got our asses kicked in the first quarter, and it’s time we move up the mat. 

BARTLET
Yes!

LEO
Say it.

BARTLET
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.

LEO
[while writing] I’m gonna talk to the staff. I’m gonna take them off the leash.

BARTLET
You have a strategy for all this?

LEO
I have the beginnings of one.

BARTLET
What is it?

LEO
I’m gonna try that out for a little while.

Leo puts the pad on the desk in front of the President. It reads, “LET BARTLET BE BARTLET.” 
The President looks at it and back to Leo as his chief of staff goes back into--
LEO’S OFFICE. The staff are still inside. Leo takes off his jacket and leans on his desk.

LEO
Listen up. Our ground game isn’t working. If we want to walk into walls, I’d want us 
running into them full speed.

JOSH
What are you saying?

LEO
Well, you can start by telling the Hill the President has named his nominees for the 
F.E.C.

Josh looks surprised.

LEO
And we’re gonna lose some of these battles, and we might even lose the White House, but 
we’re not gonna be threatened by issues. We’re gonna put them front and center. We’re 
gonna raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy.
[turns to Josh] That sound all right to you, Josh?

JOSH
I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States.

LEO
[to C.J.] Yeah?

C.J.
I serve at the pleasure of the President.

Leo turns to Sam.

SAM
I serve at the pleasure of President Bartlet.

LEO
Toby?

TOBY
I serve at the pleasure of the President.

Everyone turns their frowns into big smiles.

LEO
Good.

Leo turns to his desk and gets a clipboard. He turns back to his staff.

LEO
Then let’s get in the game!

Toby, Sam, Josh and C.J. exit. Leo walks to a table to get a pen. He looks at the open 
door to the Oval Office. He sees Bartlet, who has been standing there watching. 
Bartlet nods at him. Leo smiles back before Bartlet walks back to his desk.

West Wing S01E20
A newly energized President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) bucks tradition and throws down the gauntlet when he names two campaign finance reformers to the Federal Election Commission despite threats from his political opponents to introduce embarrassing legislation that would dare him not to sign. But the President wants to go further and floats a controversial new drug enforcement policy. In the meantime, the early reactions to his first announcement are not encouraging, especially from top-notch pollster Al Kiefer (John de Lancie) who is hired to take the public's "temperature". Kiefer's arrival means his attractive cohort, Joey Lucas (Marlee Matlin), accompanies him, and she again draws a smitten Josh's (Bradley Whitford) attention. Toby (Richard Schiff) agrees to seek out his ex-wife, Andrea Wyatt (Kathleen York), a breezy congresswoman, to gauge her response to any future narcotics legislation that would emphasize prevention over enforcement. Leo (John Spencer) -- uncomfortably aware of his own brush with drugs -- agrees to be the Chief Executive's front man for positioning the high-voltage issue of revising the drug laws.

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. SHERATON CENTER HOTEL, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
The camera pans up to Bartlet on a monitor. He is speaking in front of many people.
 
BARTLET
I get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be trusted. 
We’d better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to disperse 
even-handed justice.
 
The crowd applauds.
 
CUT TO: INT. SECLUDED AREA - CONTINUOUS
Toby and Sam are in a secluded area watching the speech on monitors. The camera pans 
over Toby's shoulder to look down on a crowd. Bartlet is standing at the podium.
 
BARTLET
We better have term limits, ‘cause voters can't be trusted to recognize corruption.

There’s another round of applause from the crowd.
 
BARTLET
Oh, and by the way... I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled and the 
process is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called elections.
 
More applause. The camera pans through the crowd.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL PRESS AREA - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is circulating the room full of reporters.
 
CHRIS
The President ate his Wheaties this morning.
 
C.J.
As a matter of fact, the President had a bowl of oatmeal this morning. He said it was 
something he's always wanted to try. [walks around the room and brushes by Danny]
Folks, listen up. In a moment or two, the President is going to say something that's 
sure to get you all shouting my name at once. There'll be a full briefing tonight at 
the White House.
 
C.J. circulates around the room. Danny approaches C.J.
 
DANNY
C.J., look....
 
C.J.
Yeah. You're not going to want to miss this.
 
The crowd applauds again.
 
REPORTER
C.J., what is this? What's going on in there?
 
C.J.
The President's going to throw his cap over the wall.
 
REPORTER
What does that mean?
 
C.J.
You're about to find out.
 
CUT TO: THE PODIUM - CONTINUOUS

BARTLET
My father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was blocked by 
a brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall, the lads 
had no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our country have 
we come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the other side?
 
FADE TO: INT. A DARK ROOM - NIGHT
The Senate Majority Leader is inside with his staff. Steve Onorato is watching Bartlet 
from a TV screen.
 
SENATOR
This was given to me by a constituent who read in Time Magazine that I like Cognac. 
The problem is, that this is Brandy and not Cognac. Anyone know the difference?
 
ONORATO
Senator?

SECRETARY
The Cognac is supposed to come from the...
 
SENATOR
...The Cognac region of France. That's right.
 
ONORATO
Senator?
 
SENATOR
Steve, sit down with us over here, would you? The man's not going to say anything we're 
interested in.
 
ONORATO
I think he is.
 
SENATOR
What are you talking about?
 
ONORATO
Listen.
 
BARTLET 
[on T.V.] Tomorrow... tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the way elections 
are supervised in this country. 
 
ONORATO
He's going to name two finance reformers to the F.E.C.
 
SENATOR
What the hell are you talking about?
 
ONORATO
Listen.
 
SENATOR
You said it wasn't going to happen.
 
ONORATO
I was wrong.
 
SENATOR
You were wrong?
 
ONORATO
He's going to name... damn it! Somebody....
 
SECRETARY
John Bacon...
 
ONORATO
John Bacon and Patty Calhoun.
 
SENATOR
You told him, they take on campaign finance reform, I roll out a legislative agenda 
that'll make his boss sit down and cry.
 
ONORATO
I made it very clear.
 
BARTLET 
[on T.V.] I am proud to nominate John Branford Bacon and Patricia Calhoun to the 
Federal Election Commission.
 
SENATOR
Get him on the phone.
 
SECRETARY
Who?
 
SENATOR
Josh Lyman. Get him on the phone. I'm going to reach down his throat and take out his 
lungs with an ice-cream scoop.
 
CUT TO: INT. SHERATON HOTEL/MONITOR AREA - NIGHT
Josh, Toby, and Sam are all decked out in tuxes.
 
SAM
You're about to get a call.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
Big call.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
Powerful guy.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
I'm just saying you're probably rocked back from your meeting last week.

JOSH
A little.
 
SAM
They threatened you with a legislative agenda.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
They made you feel powerless and you're a little off your game.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
A little gun shy.
 
In the background, a phone rings. Toby had sidled up by Sam. 
 
TOBY
Leave him alone.
 
SAM
I'm bucking him up.
 
TOBY
Leave him alone.
 
SAM
You asked me to buck him up.
 
TOBY
Now, I'm telling you to leave him alone.
 
JOSH
Guys, I'm trying to watch this speech.
 
DONNA
Josh. 
 
JOSH
The call?
 
DONNA
On the cell. [hands him the cell phone]
 
TOBY
Josh, if you need us, we're standing right here.
 
Josh turns away to answer the call.
 
JOSH 
[into phone] Hi, Senator. Why don't you take your legislative agenda and shove it up 
your ass. 

He closes the phone as the crowd applauds again. He turns back to everyone.

JOSH
Turns out I was fine.
 
He tosses phone to Donna, who catches it as we--

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
C.J. is fielding questions from a roomful of reporters. They are all clamoring for C.J.
 
REPORTER
C.J.? Is the White House concerned that the FEC will become a partisan political football?
 
C.J.
I'd like to emphasize again that the President has nominated one Democrat and one 
Republican, which he was, certainly, under no legal obligation to do. 
 
There’s more clamoring.
 
C.J.
Jesse. 
 
JESSE
In the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners were chosen...
 
C.J.
In the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners has been chosen by the President, signing off on 
whomever the Congressional Leadership pointed to.
 
STEVE
Was the Congressional Leadership aware in advance that the President would be slipping 
this announcement in his speech tonight?
 
C.J.
I think it's possible we forgot to tell them.
 
REPORTER
C.J., is the President declaring war on Congress?

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh is watching the press conference on TV.
 
JOSH
Say it's a police action.
 
C.J. 
[on T.V.] The President isn't empowered to declare war. The President is empowered. 
In fact, he's obligated to nominate Federal Agency Directors. I call it more of a 
police action. 
 
JOSH
[chuckles] How 'bout that?
 
DONNA
[enters] Toby wants you.
 
JOSH
On the phone?
 
They walk out of the office into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.
 
DONNA
In his office.
 
JOSH
Do you know why?
 
DONNA
Polling.
 
JOSH
He's bringing in Al Kiefer?
 
DONNA
Let him tell you.
 
JOSH
Why can't you tell me?
 
DONNA
'Cause you're going to his office right now. And I've got 37 different things to...
 
JOSH
[huffily] Fine.
 
He leaves and she follows into the HALLWAY.

DONNA
Josh. 
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
DONNA
Yes, he's bringing in Al Keifer.
 
JOSH
It's a big polling week, Donna. I figured he was bringing in Kiefer.
 
DONNA
Okay. 
 
JOSH
That's what you were afraid to tell me?
 
DONNA
I wasn't afraid.
 
JOSH
Okay. 
 
DONNA
The thing is, and it's going to be interesting to see how you react to this, but Kiefer 
wants to bring in a California expert.
 
JOSH
That's a good idea, cause... wait... [pause, looks]
 
DONNA
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
Joey Lucas.
 
DONNA
She's coming out with Kiefer tomorrow.
 
JOSH
Okay... okay....
 
DONNA
By the way, that's what I was afraid to tell you.
 
JOSH
You... you shouldn't have been. You know why?
 
DONNA
It's no big deal.
 
JOSH
It's no big deal. And I'll tell you what else.
 
DONNA
You're a pro.
 
JOSH
I... I am a pro. But that's not what I was going to say.
 
DONNA
What were you going to say?
 
JOSH
That's what I was going to say.
 
DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
But, both those things are true. I'm a pro and what was the other one?
 
DONNA
It's no big deal.
 
JOSH
That's right.
 
They walk into the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.
 
BONNIE
Rambo!
 
There’s a small applause.
 
JOSH
You talking to me?
 
BONNIE
Nice phone call.
 
JOSH
That's how we do things in New England, my friends. [raises is arms in victory]
 
BONNIE
In Indiana, we're not allowed to talk like that.
 
GINGER
In New Jersey, we encourage it.
 
JOSH
Where's Toby?
 
BONNIE
They're in Sam’s office.
 
Josh enters SAM’S OFFICE. Sam is typing at his desk. Toby is standing looking over Sam's 
shoulder. Josh shuts the door and sits on a chair.

JOSH
Hey. 
 
TOBY
[to Josh] Hang on. [to Sam] That's good... good... Okay... Sam?
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
You're going to come to a verb soon, right?
 
SAM
Okay. You know what this is called?
 
TOBY
Bad writing?
 
SAM
Imagery.
 
TOBY
Well, you say potato... Josh, it's a big polling week. I'm bringing in Al Kiefer. 
 
JOSH
You've turned 180 degrees on Kiefer. You know that?
 
TOBY
I haven't turned on Kiefer at all. I don't want him advising the President. I want him 
bringing us numbers.
 
JOSH
Advising people is what pollsters do.
 
TOBY
He'll do what I tell him to do. Also....
 
JOSH
English as the National Language.
 
SAM
That's the first thing they're going to fight back with, Josh. 
 
TOBY
We need Hispanics. You know what state has a large population of Hispanics?
 
JOSH
Uh... I want to say Maine, but uh... 
 
TOBY
California.
 
JOSH
California. Damn, and I was only off by a continent.
 
TOBY
Josh. 
 
JOSH
It's fine. Bring her out here.
 
TOBY
She'll be here tomorrow.
 
JOSH
This isn't a thing. 
 
TOBY
Okay. 
 
JOSH
I met her twice, Toby.
 
SAM
Yeah, but, one of those times, she broke your heart. You know the way women can do. 
Where they take your heart and they throw it on the floor and then they stomp on it 
with their big high heals. She’s a very beautiful and interesting woman. I can see why 
a lot of guys would go for her. [pause] You know, there's nothing at all I'm saying now 
of any value. So, I think the thing to do is... I think I should just keep writing.
 
JOSH
Okay. [gets up] We had a good night.
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
[at the door] C.J.'s doing great in there.

He leaves. Toby is still looking over Sam's shoulder.
 
TOBY 
Any time you want to use punctuation, that'd be fine.
 
CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
The press clamors for C.J.

C.J.
I'm going to take one more question. Katie.
 
KATIE
The Federal Elections Commission's role has never been that much more than symbolic...
 
C.J.
I wouldn't say the F.E.C. was merely symbolic, but if you're suggesting they're 
toothless, I'll agree with you.
 
KATIE
Given that, does the White House think that two new commissioners will make any 
difference?
 
C.J.
No. 
 
KATIE
Then why do it?
 
C.J.
Symbolism. There'll be plenty more tomorrow. Everybody have a good night.
 
The reporters clamor for C.J. but she heads off to Carol near the door.
 
C.J.
Carol. 

She whispers. Carol walks to a reporter, JACK, who is sitting in front of Danny.
 
CAROL
Jack, C.J.'s inviting you back to follow up on a couple of things.
 
JACK
Me? 
 
CAROL
Yeah. 
 
JACK
She doesn't want me. [turns to Danny] She wants Danny.
 
CAROL
No, she asked for you.
 
JACK
Danny -- The Senior White House Correspondent. If there's going to be an exclusive with 
the Press Secretary...
 
DANNY
Go. She wants you.
 
C.J. glances at Danny before she leaves the room.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - DAY
TUESDAY MORNING
Sam and Toby are crossing a street.
 
SAM
Mandatory Minimums are racist.
 
TOBY
I understand that.
 
SAM
They're a red herring.
 
TOBY
I understand that, too.
 
SAM
It's a way of looking like you're tough on crime, without assuming the burden of being 
tough on crime.
 
TOBY
Everything you've said I understand.
 
SAM
I'm saying...
 
TOBY
We do things one thing at a time.
 
SAM
But I'm saying we don't have time to do things one thing at a time. 
 
TOBY
We're talking about treatment.
 
SAM
I'm talking about treatment and I'm talking about Mandatory Minimums and I'm saying it's 
a red herring and I'm saying it's racist.
 
TOBY
When you talk to the President, I want you talking about treatment. I want you talking 
about treatment vs. enforcement and I don't want you to stray from that!
 
SAM
Toby, is this what you meant when you said, "Sam, you're completely in charge of this"?
 
TOBY
Yes, I meant, you're in charge of this, in the sense that you're subordinate to me in 
every way. [stops walking and looks around] Where is this place?
 
SAM
What place?
 
TOBY
The breakfast place.
 
SAM
It's still on the last street.
 
TOBY
Why didn't you say anything?
 
SAM
We were having a nice conversation.
 
Toby looks a bit annoyed and heads back in the other direction. 
 
CUT TO: INT. AN OUTDOOR PATIO - DAY
Leo is seated at a table and Margaret is standing beside him.
 
WAITRESS
Mr. McGarry, would you like some tomato juice while waiting for the others?
 
LEO
Thanks, Celia.
 
MARGARET is still standing fussing with some #2 pencils She sits down and fusses a bit 
with her place settings.
 
LEO
All set there?
 
MARGARET
Yeah.
 
Josh and Donna enter the patio area.
 
JOSH
Leo. We couldn't meet closer to the office?
 
LEO
I don't want people coming by the table.
 
JOSH
We couldn't meet in the office?
 
LEO
I was hungry.
 
JOSH
We couldn't have food ordered?
 
LEO
Oh, sit down, would you?
 
DONNA
You should notice that Josh has on a nice suit.
 
MARGARET
That is a nice suit.
 
JOSH
Donna. 
 
DONNA
We'll call it his Joy Lucas suit....
 
JOSH
Donna. 
 
DONNA
...you know from now on.
 
MARGARET
Joey Lucas is coming?
 
JOSH
We need a California expert and this is my regular Tuesday suit.
 
MARGARET
You assign your clothes days of the week?
 
JOSH
I'm saying there's no particular M.O. behind...
 
Toby and Sam enter.
 
SAM
Found it.
 
LEO
About time. Sit down.
 
SAM
Ah, Leo....
 
LEO
Hang on. [to Toby] Talk to me about drugs.
 
TOBY
We can make a case for treatment vs. enforcement and we're ready to go to the President.
 
A cell phone rings.
 
SAM
We're also ready to go to the President with Mandatory Minimums on crack versus powder 
cocaine. 
 
LEO
One step at a time.
 
SAM
That's what Toby just said.
 
LEO
Toby’s right.
 
SAM
Yes, but does anyone remember that I was put in charge.
 
LEO
It was an honorary kind of thing, Sam.
 
MARGARET
Leo. [hands Leo the cell phone]
 
LEO 
[into phone] Yeah.
 
WAITRESS 
[to the others] Are you ready to order?
 
LEO 
[to Margaret] Write these names down: Dalton, Dawson, Foxworthy, Greer, Morgenthau, 
Stackhouse, and Sugarbaker. [into phone] Thank you.
 
TOBY
What was that?
 
LEO
You know what that was.
 
MARGARET
Leo, what do you want me to do with this thing?
 
LEO
Hold on to them until I say so.
 
TOBY
It's exactly the right thing to do.
 
LEO
From anybody but me.
 
JOSH
I'd like to clear up that I... I don't have suits for the days of the week. This is 
just a regular suit. 
 
SAM
It's a nice suit.
 
DONNA
Sure, it's a nice suit. It's his Joey Lucas....
 
JOSH
Donna! 
 
DONNA
I'm beginning to regret not getting the waffles.
 
LEO 
[exasperated] I am beginning to regret having hired any of you. We have a 42% job 
approval and you're talking about waffles and something with Josh, I don't understand.
 
DONNA
He's wearing a special suit for Joey Lucas.
 
LEO
You got dressed up for a guy named Joey?
 
JOSH
Joey... Joey Lucas is a woman... and I'm not getting dressed up for her.
 
DONNA
It's his regular Tuesday suit.
 
LEO
My point is... we have to make it through the week without making any mistakes.
 
JOSH
We will.
 
LEO
I'm saying that this is...
 
JOSH
I'm saying calm down.
 
LEO
I'm perfectly calm.
 
SAM
You're not calm, Leo. You're acting like a nervous hooleelia.

Everyone looks at Sam.
 
TOBY
A what?
 
SAM
It may not be a word. It may just be something my mother used to say.
 
FADE OUT.

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Toby, C.J., Josh, Sam, Leo, Bartlet, and Al Kiefer are sitting in various seats.

AL
It's a huge mistake.
 
BARTLET
Al... 
 
AL
It is a huge mistake, Mr. President. And possibly a fatal one. It'll doom the midterms 
in November. It'll haunt you at the convention. And if you manage to get renominated, 
which is far from a lock, there's no way you'll win reelection. 
 
SAM
Al's Mr. Good News Happy Guy. 

Bartlet smirks.
 
Al
Sam. For the first time, more voters disapprove than approve of the President's job 
performance, 42% approval. This is not the time to come out for legalization.
 
SAM
We're not coming out for legalization.
 
Mandy enters. Both C.J. and Toby move towards her. C.J. ushers Mandy out of the Oval 
Office.

MANDY
You're kidding.
 
C.J.
No. 
 
MANDY
He doesn't want me in there?
 
C.J.
Leo’s not comfortable with it.
 
MANDY
Leo’s not comfortable with it. 
 
C.J.
No. 
 
MANDY
I want to talk to the President.
 
C.J.
You can't.
 
MANDY
C.J. 
 
C.J.
You can't.
 
MANDY
It was just a memo.
 
C.J.
It wasn't just a memo.
 
MANDY
The fact that you guys....
 
C.J.
Do you have any idea how pissed people are at you? 
 
MANDY
C.J. 
 
C.J.
They're pissed at me, that's how pissed they are at you. They want to know how the hell 
I didn't know about the memo.
 
MANDY
I can be trusted.
 
C.J.
We'll see. There's plenty for you to do. Leo would feel more comfortable if you stayed 
out of this...
 
MANDY
Okay. Okay! [walks away in a huff]

Sir. 
 
TOBY
Listen to Sam.
 
SAM
Drug control appropriations...
 
JOSH
...which total 17.6 billion...
 
SAM
...are divided into a ratio of 2/3 enforcement, 1/3 treatment. We want to reverse that 
ratio.
 
AL
Spend less money on drug enforcement?
 
SAM
So that we can spend more money on treatment.
 
AL
So, you're soft on crime.
 
SAM
Al... 
 
AL
You don't care if kids shoot up on the playground at recess.
 
BARTLET
We don't care do we, Sam?
 
SAM
No, sir.
 
LEO

BARTLET
Kiefer's been here 45 minutes, he's already got me on the playground at recess.
 
LEO 
[to Al] Took you 45 minutes?
 
TOBY
Mr. President, Sam and I have been working with the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, we have some numbers you should hear.
 
Charlie comes in and catches Josh's eye. Josh gets up and leaves.

Hey, Joey. Hey, Kenny. Good to see you. I got your desks set up out here. Why don't you 
come with me? [walks out]

JOEY
Hey! 
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
JOEY [KENNY]
My flight was fine, thank you.
 
They reach JOEY’S OFFICE.

JOSH
Joey, we're in a bit of a mode here and I think it's best if we just do business. Plus, 
this is the White House. I wouldn't expect candy and flowers on your arrival.
 
Margaret enters carrying some flowers.
 
MARGARET
Excuse me. Joey? These are from Leo McGarry. [presents her with flowers] 
He says welcome and let him know if there's anything you need.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Well, that's so sweet. Thank him for me.
 
MARGARET
I will. Did you have a good flight?
 
JOSH 
[a bit sternly to Margaret] Go back to your office.
 
JOEY
They're carnations.
 
JOSH
This is your desk. You got a phone. You got a computer. You got access to a staff. 
I know how women like to personalize their desks with flowers, and plants, and hand 
lotion, but I prefer the place to be professional.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Your staff likes to decorate their desks with hand lotion?
 
JOSH
Some of them might, and I'm saying we don't do that on my side of the building. 
[pause] I'm going to go back to this meeting and then I'll brief you on what I need.
 
JOEY
Okay. 
 
Josh leaves. Joey follows him out into the hall.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
I'm not sleeping with Al Kiefer anymore.
 
Josh abruptly stops in his tracks and turns to face Joey. The staffers all stop and 
gawk at Joey and Josh.
 
JOSH
Come here. [motions to Joey]
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Can I help you?
 
JOSH
Yes! 
 
JOEY [KENNY]
How?
 
JOSH
By coming here! 

He motions for her to approach him. She walks toward him.
 
JOSH
This is a place where solemn work is done. This is a place... this is a place... let me 
say this... this is not a place where one's personal things... where things among people... 
this is not a place... let's... This is a place where work is done and nothing else.
 
JOEY
You bet.
 
JOSH
Okay. [turns to leave]
 
JOEY
Nice suit.

JOSH
[pauses to look at her] I'll... I'll be back.
 
C.J. suddenly catches up with Josh. They stop in the lobby.
 
C.J.
Josh, listen. I misspoke last night. I said the President nominated a Democrat and a 
Republican, even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. It turns out he is.
 
JOSH 
[sighs] C.J....
 
C.J.
I know.
 
JOSH
This from the White House counsel?
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
You sure?
 
C.J.
About what?
 
JOSH
You said he nominated a Democrat and a Republican.
 
C.J.
Even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. Yeah, I just looked at the 
transcript.
 
JOSH
All right. You'll fix it at the briefing?
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
Don't worry about it. [leaves C.J. standing in the lobby]

SAM
The American Medical Association says that addiction is a disease.
 
AL
You're not going to be able to sell that.
 
SAM
Al! 
 
AL
You're not going to be able to sell it.
 
TOBY
The A.M.A. says it, why does it he have to sell it?
 
AL
Because...
 
TOBY
Drug addiction is a disease. It's a... it's... it's a... medical problem. It can be 
treated. This isn't ideological. It's science.
 
AL
It's science to you.
 
TOBY 
[big sigh] Science is science to everybody, Al.
 
JOSH
[enters] What'd I miss?
 
BARTLET
Toby was just explaining to Al that science is science to everyone.
 
AL
And I believe that science is science to everybody. I just don't think you can sell that.
 
JOSH
I'm sorry, Mr. President. While Al tries to come up with something easier to sell than 
science, would you mind if I spoke to Toby and Leo alone?
 
BARTLET
Go. 
 
Before Josh leaves with Toby and Leo, he gives Al an odd look. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh, Toby and Leo enter.
 
JOSH
So... 
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
Hey, Joey Lucas says she's not with Kiefer anymore.
 
LEO
Well that's a load off our minds.
 
JOSH
Yeah... uh... C.J. misspoke last night during her briefing... uh, she'll fix it when 
she gets back in there. 
 
TOBY
What did she say?
 
JOSH
She said the President nominated a Democrat and a Republican when he was under no legal 
obligation to do so.
 
LEO
He is under a legal obligation.
 
JOSH
She knows that now.
 
LEO
This is just the kind of dumb mistake we don't need right now. 
 
JOSH
She knows that, too.
 
LEO
All right, what are you gonna do?
 
JOSH
How's it going in there?
 
LEO
Sam’s just starting.
 
JOSH
You talked to him about the thing, yet? [pointing at Toby] 
 
LEO
No. 
 
TOBY
Me? 
 
LEO
Yeah, listen....
 
JOSH
We want you to go to a meeting.
 
TOBY
With who?
 
JOSH
A prominent House Democrat who has a voice on Campaign Finance Reform and if it was 
someone on the Ethics Committee that'd be even better, cause then she could answer some 
of Leo’s questions.
 
TOBY 
[pause, smiles a bit] I used to be married to someone who fits that description.
 
LEO
I set up lunch for the two of you.
 
TOBY
You set me up on a date with my ex-wife?
 
LEO
Yeah. Let her know the President's not going to ask the democrats to unilaterally drop 
soft money.
 
JOSH
Make that clear.
 
LEO
And also take her temperature on the ethics thing.
 
TOBY
Okay.

He looks back and forth at Leo and Josh before heading back to the Oval Office.
 
JOSH
See ya later. [starts to leave but turns around] Leo, you had to send flowers?
 
LEO
It's a nice thing to do.
 
JOSH
Yeah, but I had this whole patter thing going... and then... the hell with it. [exits]
 
LEO
Margaret!
 
MARGARET
[comes in] Yes.
 
LEO
The list of names I gave you before?
 
MARGARET
Dalton, Dawson, Foxworthy, Greer, Morgenthau, Stackhouse, Sugarbaker.
 
LEO
You didn't have to memorize them.
 
MARGARET
I couldn't help it.
 
LEO
Okay. 
 
MARGARET
My mind works that way.
 
LEO
Yes, call their offices. I want to see one representative apiece at two o'clock. I want 
them as a group. 
 
MARGARET
In the office?
 
LEO
In the press briefing room. [walks toward the door]

MARGARET
Leo.
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
MARGARET
What do those seven people have in common?
 
LEO
Don't worry about it.
 
He enters the Oval Office and closes the door.

JOSH
Hello. 
 
JOEY
Hello. 
 
JOSH
I see you're all settled in.
 
JOEY
Ah, yes, yes.
 
JOSH
Area looks good. Not too many personal items. Got your little clock, that's fine.
 
JOEY
Thank you.
 
JOSH
Here's the story. The President announced last night, he's naming two Campaign Finance 
Reform minded nominees to the F.E.C. This will anger the Republican Leadership to the 
extent they'll retaliate. Retaliate, how? They'll introduce a series of bills design to 
put the President on the wrong side of public debates. The first will be a law making 
English the National language.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
I already know this, Josh. I've been working on it since Toby called me.
 
JOSH
Joey... 
 
Joey's alarm clock rings.
 
JOEY
Lunchtime.
 
Kenny and Joey take off. Josh leans back in his seat.

in jail for drug related crimes.
 
AL
Sam... 
 
SAM
At a cost, for those prisoners alone...
 
AL
Sam!
 
SAM
...of 2 million dollars a day.
 
TOBY
Mr. President, we can sell the public on the idea that 2 million bucks a day can be put 
to better use.
 
AL
Not if it's for treatment.
 
SAM
Yes, if it's for treatment. Yes, we can demonstrate that treatment is what prevents 
substance abuse.
 
AL
And yes, if you can get people to sit still long enough to hear that argument. But, it 
takes a lot less time to hear "Just Say No" And anyone on the other side is soft on crime.
 
SAM
The A.M.A....
 
AL
Can't sell it!
 
BARTLET
Can't sell science?
 
AL
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
I'm hungry and so far nobody has convinced me of anything.

Sam leaves the Oval Office and meets up with Cathy.

CATHY
Hey, Sam. How's it going?
 
SAM
Uh, we're in the early stages.
 
CATHY
Do you know what you want for lunch?
 
SAM
That's an interesting question.
 
CATHY
Sam. 
 
SAM
I could have turkey.
 
CATHY
Sam. 
 
SAM
I could have some fish.
 
CATHY
Would you like to look at the menu?
 
SAM
A nice piece of fish never hurt anyone, Cathy.
 
Sam enters his office to find Steve Onorato waiting for him.
 
ONORATO
Hey, Sam.
 
SAM
Steve. 
 
ONORATO
There was an O.M.B. meeting downstairs. I wanted to see you. They said you were with 
the President that I should wait here. 
 
SAM
Yes. This is about the F.E.C. nominees?
 
ONORATO
Ah, look...
 
SAM
You don't want to see me, you want to see Josh.
 
ONORATO
I was hoping you and I could talk.
 
SAM
On the F.E.C., Josh is the guy.
 
ONORATO
Josh isn't quite himself lately.
 
SAM
Steve. 
 
ONORATO
"Take your legislative agenda and shove it up your ass"? 
 
SAM
That sounds exactly like Josh to me.
 
ONORATO
My boss is ready to set the building on fire.
 
SAM
Then your boss will be arrested, as I'm quite sure that's against the law.
 
ONORATO
Look, don't mess with me Sam, I'm serious.
 
SAM
And I'm tired, and this isn't my thing. Go see Josh.
 
ONORATO
You gonna eat?
 
SAM
What? 
 
ONORATO
Lunch. Are you gonna eat?
 
SAM
Yeah, but at my desk, I was just gonna get...
 
ONORATO
What are you having?
 
SAM
Turkey. 
 
ONORATO
Get two. 

He takes off his jacket and sits down. Sam looks a little off-balanced at being ambushed 
by Onorato.

Congresswoman ANDREA WYATT is sitting on a picnic blanket. Toby is standing nearby.
 
ANDREA WYATT
It’s a beautiful day.
 
TOBY
Yes. 
 
ANDY
This is nice. It's like a picnic.
 
TOBY
There are restaurants, you know, indoors, with waiters and tables.
 
ANDY
You should come sit next to me. [pats the blanket]
 
TOBY
I'm wearing a suit.
 
ANDY
So am I.
 
TOBY
I'm a responsible adult.
 
ANDY
I'm a member of the United States Congress.
 
TOBY
I rest my case.
 
ANDY
You know what I got?
 
TOBY
What? 
 
ANDY
I got pie. [pulls out a Tupperware container from her bag]
 
TOBY
Andy. 
 
ANDY
Toby, I’ve got really good pie. It's homemade. [takes a piece of the pie and eats it]
 
TOBY
You baked a pie?
 
ANDY
No, I didn't mean I made it in my home.
 
TOBY
Let's go. 
 
ANDY
[puts the Tupperware in her bag] This pie was baked for me by one of my constituents.
 
TOBY
And you trust it?
 
ANDY
Well, that's why I was hoping you'd eat it first.
 
TOBY
Andy. 
 
She gets up and picks up her blanket. Toby and Andy start to walk by the Tidal Basin.

ANDY
Want to talk about the F.E.C.?
 
TOBY
The President's not gonna ask anyone to give up soft money unilaterally.
 
ANDY
You're still going to hear from Stadler and Ross.
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
ANDY
Probably from McCovey, Lester, Brock...probably Klesko, Trask...
 
TOBY
Ritchie.
 
ANDY
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
But we have your people in line?
 
ANDY
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
What about drugs?
 
ANDY
That's a different story.
 
TOBY
Andy... 
 
ANDY
Mandatory Minimums are racist.
 
TOBY
One step at a time.
 
ANDY
It's part of the same step.
 
TOBY
Treatment.
 
ANDY
I'm saying Mandatory Minimums...
 
They each try to talk over one another.
 
TOBY
I know what you're saying. I don't want to talk about Mandatory Minimums.
 
ANDY
The Sentencing Commissioners...
 
TOBY
Andy, I don't want to...
 
ANDY
...proposals regarding cocaine recommend that relative federal mandatory minimums 
sentencing crack users...
 
TOBY
This is what happens. This is what you do. I say I don't want to talk about Mandatory 
Minimums and we talk about Mandatory Minimums anyway. You hijack my ability to make that 
decision for myself, Andrea. And making decisions for myself is my birthright!
 
ANDY
Good to get that off you chest there, Pokey?
 
TOBY
Yes. 
 
ANDY
Okay. 
 
TOBY
You don't have a problem with what Leo’s gonna do?
 
ANDY
No, but I want to be there.

Why? 
 
ANDY
Just for fun.
 
TOBY
It's not fun, Andy.
 
ANDY
Okay. 
 
TOBY
It's not fun...
 
ANDY
Okay. 
 
TOBY
Not everything is fun....
 
ANDY
Okay!
 
TOBY
If you want to be there, you can be there, but this is a serious thing.
 
ANDY
Can I bring my pie?
 
TOBY
Andy. 
 
ANDY
I'm just saying it's a serious thing. There might not be any food there.
 
TOBY
Can you walk faster, please? I really don't like to be outdoors this long.
 
Andy speeds up her pace a bit to keep up with Toby.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam is arguing with Onorato while eating lunch.
 
ONORATO
The fact is we'll probably have to confirm your nominees. 
 
SAM 
[mouthful] Yeah.
 
ONORATO
They're too qualified.
 
SAM
They're too qualified?
 
ONORATO
Too qualified not to confirm.
 
SAM
That's a problem.
 
ONORATO
I'm saying, there's no political cover.
 
SAM
I understood what you're saying.
 
ONORATO
So my question is....
 
SAM
Steve, the F.E.C. nominees aren't my thing.
 
ONORATO
I'm not talking about the F.E.C. now. I'm talking about drugs. You're gearing up to 
announce a new drug policy.
 
SAM
We've been gearing up for 14 months.
 
ONORATO
Yeah, but now you're taking daylong strategy sessions in the Oval Office.
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
ONORATO
Drugs are obviously important to you.
 
SAM
Important to everyone.
 
ONORATO
I mean, particularly to you. You've been the point man at the White House.
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
ONORATO
So why do you want to trade it in for a move on campaign finance? It's not going to get 
you anywhere.
 
SAM
It's gonna get me somewhere and I'm not trading it in.
 
ONORATO
You are.
 
SAM
We're not bartering.
 
ONORATO
I'm saying without the F.E.C. nominations, there's room to work with us.
 
SAM
And with the nominations?
 
ONORATO
You can have all the strategy sessions you want. No one you need's gonna take your phone 
call. And you, Sam, can go back to writing speeches for when the President meets the Girl 
Scout who sold the most cupcakes.
 
Cathy knocks on Sam’s door and enters.
 
CATHY
Sam. 
 
SAM 
[to Onorato] Cookies.
 
ONORATO
Huh?
 
SAM
[takes his jacket and heads out] Girl Scouts sells cookies, not cupcakes. And it was a 
pretty good speech, I wrote. It was about volunteerism. 
 
ONORATO
Well keep up the good work, Sam.

Okay. [heads out as C.J. follows]
 
C.J.
Carol’s keeping the press in the northeast lobby. She'll wait for your high sign.

We're telling anyone who asks why the press is out of there that it's a special event.
 
LEO
Good. 
 
C.J.
Leo, I don't know if you've heard...
 
LEO
Yeah, I did hear C.J. You want me to tell you how many different ways that screw-up was 
stupid?
 
C.J.
I know.
 
LEO
For one thing, don't pass yourself off as a legal authority. For another, what the hell 
are you doing using a phrase like "under no legal obligation"?
 
C.J.
Leo. 
 
LEO
You're parsing at a time when the whole idea...
 
C.J.
I know. 
 
LEO
So right out of the gate, we've got to go back.
 
C.J.
Yes. 
 
LEO
These amateur mistakes make me crazy, C.J.
 
C.J.
Yes. 
 
LEO
I'll be in there in a minute. 

He exits through a door leaving C.J. alone in the hallway.
 
DANNY [OS]
That was bush league. 

Danny, who was talking to several reporters down the hall, is now walking towards C.J. 
They head for her office. 

DANNY
That was bush league what you did last night.
 
C.J.
We'll talk in my office.
 
DANNY
And why can't anyone go in the Press Room?
 
C.J.
There's a meeting in there.
 
DANNY
What kind of meeting?
 
C.J.
None of your business.
 
DANNY
It's the Press Room.
 
They walk by Carol's desk.
 
C.J.
Hi, Carol.
 
DANNY
Hi, Carol.
 
CAROL
Hi. 
 
C.J. and Danny enter C.J.'S OFFICE. C.J. shuts the door.
 
C.J.
Don't talk to me like that in front of people.
 
DANNY
Look...
 
C.J.
No! I just got called amateur twice in 10 seconds. The White House Chief of Staff can do 
it to me wherever he wants. You don't do it in front of people.
 
DANNY
If I don't have access anymore, I don't have a job.
 
C.J.
I would think a man with your credentials...
 
DANNY
You think I'm kidding around?
 
C.J.
[yells] You think I am?!
 
DANNY
The memo was news.
 
C.J.
Says you.
 
DANNY
That's right. Says me -- says me, says my editor, says every paper who picked it up the 
next day. Says Time, says Newsweek...
 
C.J.
Congratulations, you're a movie star. You're also on the outside looking in for a while, 
so get used to it.
 
DANNY
Used to it? I'm paid for it, and what you don't understand.... 
 
C.J.
DON’T tell me what I don't understand! I'm not in my freshman year anymore. I understand 
more than you think.
 
CAROL
[knocks] C.J.? 
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
CAROL
Leo’s on his way in.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY
Seven people are sitting around. Leo enters. C.J. and Carol are guarding the doors.
 
LEO
Good afternoon. I'll make this as quick and direct as I can. There's a chance...
 
STUART
Why are we in the Press Room?
 
LEO
This will be pretty fast, Stuart. Faster still if I'm not interrupted. There's a chance 
that a debate is about to begin over the best way to fight the drug problem in this 
country. The White House, being among those, who believe more money should be put into 
treatment. The people you work for, being among those who believe we should put more 
money into prisons. 
 
Andy and Toby quietly enter from the back and sit.
 
DICK
Leo, why the 7 of us?
 
LEO
Dick, in July of '96, your boss's son was arrested for carrying 25 grams of cocaine. 
That's a crime that usually carries... what Toby?
 
TOBY
Eight to 15 years.
 
LEO
And what did the Congressman's son get?
 
TOBY
Six months house arrest.
 
LEO
Lynn, your boss's husband was caught stealing Vicodin and Percocet from the hospital at 
which he served as Chief of Thoracic Surgery. Now, Vicodin and Percocet are schedule-two 
drugs in the same legal category as Opium. What was the blue-book value, Toby?
 
TOBY
Each stolen pill carries the penalty of one year in prison and a monetary fine.
 
LEO
And what did we have for the Congresswoman's husband?
 
TOBY
He went to a pre-trial diversion program. There's no longer any criminal record.
 
LEO
That's not bad.
 
STUART
Leo, I...
 
LEO
Stuart, yours is my favorite. Your boss has a daughter who was pulled over with 31 grams 
of coke and charged with intent to deliver. More over, she's just been indicted by a 
federal grand jury in Greenville, South Carolina, along with 18 other people for 
conspiracy to distribute. Toby...
 
TOBY
She paid a fine of $2800 and forfeited her car in which the drugs were found.
 
LEO
The President wants a lively debate. 

Leo gives C.J. a signal. C.J. signals to Carol.

LEO
He wants to hear opposition, but he's not gonna stomach hypocrisy. We start hearing 
"soft on criminals", "soft on drugs" from any of the people you work for, we've got 7 
stories ready for page one. 
 
C.J. and Carol let the press into the room.
 
STUART
You're saber-rattling.
 
LEO
Here comes the White House Press Corps. Let's find out.
 
STUART
We're done here. 

All seven people get up to leave.
 
LEO
You play the full nine innings at this level, Stuart. Tell your friends about it.
 
CAROL 
[to the press] Take your seats, please. C.J. will start the briefing.
 
We follow Andy and Toby as they come out of the Press Room into the HALLWAY.
 
ANDY
[sighs] Can I tell you something? 
 
TOBY
Listen.
 
ANDY
Watching you guys do that....
 
TOBY
Andy. 
 
ANDY
It was a little fun.
 
TOBY
That was not fun.
 
ANDY
You should've had some pie.
 
TOBY
I have to get back to work. And you, being a Congresswoman... I'm sure you need to be 
back out there... you know, screwing the people.
 
ANDY
I should tell you something.
 
TOBY
What? 
 
ANDY
In the interest of full disclosure.
 
TOBY
What? 
 
ANDY
The other night, I was out on a date. We had a couple glasses of wine. He pulled the 
car up, bumped the guy ahead of us. The cop was there. He was going to give him a 
blood-alcohol test, but then he recognized me. 
 
TOBY
That's fine.
 
ANDY
I'm just saying....
 
TOBY
You didn't say, "Officer, I'm a member of Congress, isn't there anything we can do 
about this?"
 
ANDY
No. 
 
TOBY
Who were you out with?
 
ANDY
A guy named Victor Stipe.
 
TOBY
Executive advisor for the Orioles?
 
ANDY
Yeah. 
 
They stop walking.

TOBY
You went out on a date with the executive advisor for the Baltimore Orioles?
 
ANDY
Toby, are you upset that I went out on a date? Or are you upset that I went out on a 
date with someone who plays in the same division as the Yankees?
 
TOBY
Honest to God, I'm not sure.
 
They enter TOBY'S OFFICE.
 
ANDY
Mandatory Minimums, Toby.
 
TOBY
What are you doing getting into cars with guys that have been drinking?
 
They start talking at the same time again.

ANDY
Cause I'm a grown woman....
 
TOBY
That's what taxicabs are for.
 
ANDY
And I will get into whatever car....
 
TOBY
And also, I can still do that.
 
ANDY
[stops and stares at Toby] You'd come pick me up with a date?
 
TOBY
If it wasn't an Oriole, absolutely. Or a Red Sock. In fact, just date the National 
League, would you? 
 
He pauses as they stare at each other.
 
ANDY
Toby, I'm not kidding. Mandatory Minimums. 
 
TOBY
Go away.
 
ANDY
It's good seeing you. 

She plays a bit with Toby’s lapels and gets ready to leave.
 
TOBY
Andy? 
 
ANDY
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
Let me have the pie.
 
Andy sighs and hands him the Tupperware with the pie and walks out the door smiling 
the whole time. Toby stands a bit at the door and watches her go.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
11:30 P.M.
Bartlet is asleep. Some books are scattered on the bed. There’s a knock on the door. 
Leo enters the dark room.
 
LEO
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
[groggily] Yeah.
 
LEO
Oh, you're in bed?
 
BARTLET
Yeah. 
 
LEO
When I called, you were awake.
 
BARTLET
Well, yeah, that's cause I answered the phone. [turns on the lamp]

LEO
I was just coming by to talk. It can wait.
 
BARTLET 
What's on your mind? [waves for Leo to come in]

LEO
You sure?
 
BARTLET
Yeah, I got to be up in four hours, anyway.
 
CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh is working at his desk. Charlie knocks and enters.
 
JOSH
Hey. 
 
CHARLIE
Hey. What are you doing?
 
JOSH
F.E.C. Where's the President?
 
CHARLIE
He went to the residence about an hour ago. So, I couldn't help noticing coming over 
here that the light in Joey Lucas's office is on.
 
JOSH
She's still here?
 
CHARLIE
Yeah.
 
JOSH
Why are you telling me?
 
CHARLIE
She's a fine looking...
 
JOSH
Charlie.
 
CHARLIE
Okay.
 
JOSH
Have a good night.
 
CHARLIE
You give her a little something.
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
CHARLIE
"Here this is for you, cause it's your first day. You don't know anybody." Bam -- you 
give it to her. You say something nice.
 
JOSH 
[waves to Charlie] See you tomorrow.
 
CHARLIE
Take it easy. 

He leaves as Sam and Toby enter.
 
SAM
Hey, Charlie.
 
CHARLIE
Hey.
 
TOBY 
[to Sam] Tell him what you told me.
 
SAM
See... uh... I still don't understand.
 
TOBY
Tell him what you told me.
 
SAM
Steve Onorato came to see me this afternoon. We had lunch.
 
JOSH
Onorato came to you?
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
Tell him what he said.
 
SAM
He said that if we dropped F.E.C., he could warm things up for drugs. 
 
Josh and Toby start snickering.
 
SAM
I don't understand.
 
JOSH
He said that?
 
TOBY
He even pointed out to Sam that Sam was working on drugs for the White House.
 
JOSH
[grinning] You made the big time, Sam.
 
SAM
What's going on?
 
JOSH
He knows about Laurie.
 
SAM
What do you mean?
 
TOBY
He knows you’re friends with a call girl.
 
SAM
What does that have to do with anything?
 
JOSH
He wants to move you out to the front of the field so he can drop Laurie on you.
 
SAM
Are you serious?
 
JOSH
Yeah. 
 
SAM
Are you serious?!
 
JOSH
It's okay, Sam. You haven't done anything wrong.
 
SAM
Oh, I know I haven't done anything wrong. Are you serious? 
 
TOBY 
[chuckling] We're serious. Don't worry about it.
 
SAM
He... are you saying, he... he tried to practice on my... 
 
TOBY
...credulous simplicity?
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
SAM
Alright. I want to know what I can do right now.
 
JOSH
Sam. 
 
SAM
No, right now! At 11:35. I want to know what I can do.
 
JOSH
Take it easy.
 
SAM
I won’t take it easy! Give me the phone. [reaches for the phone] I'm gonna call the 
Senator and I'm gonna tell him that he can shove his legislative agenda up his ass!
 
Toby and Josh try to restrain the phone from Sam.
 
JOSH
I've already done that.
 
SAM
I'll do it again.
 
JOSH
You know what this is like? This is like The Godfather. When Pacino tells James Caan 
that he's gonna kill the cop. It's a lot like that scene, only not really.
 
TOBY
Did Leo go home?
 
JOSH
He's... he's still here somewhere.
 
SAM
He's in the Residence.
 
JOSH
It is like that scene. I'm James Caan. [to Sam] You're...you're Al Pacino.
 
TOBY
Let's go.
 
JOSH
Toby, you're the guy who shows Pacino how to make tomato sauce. 
 
TOBY 
[to Sam] Let's go.
 
They all leave JOSH’S OFFICE.
 
JOSH
I'll be right behind, I'm gonna pick up the late wires.

He pauses and stares down the hall toward JOEY’S OFFICE. He enters while hiding 
something behind his back.
 
JOSH
Hello. 
 
JOEY
Hi. 
 
JOSH
Hey, Kenny.
 
KENNY
Hey, Josh.
 
JOSH
I saw the light was on. You guys are here late.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
I wanted to give you first look analysis in the morning. There's really some decent 
models in Marin County and the Bay Area. But San Jose is a mess and so is Orange County, 
Long Beach, Anaheim, and San Diego.
 
JOSH
I brought you a coffee mug.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Why?
 
JOSH
Just as a thing, cause you don't know anybody. It's got... uh... a picture of the White 
House. It says, “The White House.” Seal of the President. It's a White House coffee mug.
 
JOEY
Thank you.
 
JOSH
Kenny, can you give us a second?
 
KENNY
Oh, sure. [signing to Joey] I'm going to step outside. [walks away]
 
JOSH
I wore this suit, special today. This isn't my regular Tuesday suit.
 
JOEY
You have a regular Tuesday suit?
 
JOSH
No. 
 
JOEY
For me?
 
JOSH
Yeah... So... Okay, I gotta go. [smiles wide as Josh leaves]

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Leo is sitting next to the President's bed.
 
LEO
So... I don't want to be Labor the point, though. I... I do think this is understandable. 
I feel a little self-conscience coming down the mountain on drugs two months after I 
announce I was a recovering drug addict. What do you think?
 
BARTLET
About what?
 
LEO
What I just said.
 
BARTLET
Well, I wasn't listening to a lot of it.
 
LEO
Sir... 
 
BARTLET
Leo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment vs. criminal 
action, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now, if you'd had 
gone to jail instead of rehab?
 
LEO
No. 
 
BARTLET
Thank you. Is there anything else?

Someone knocks.

BARTLET
Apparently there is.
 
C.J.
[enters] Mr. President. 
 
BARTLET
Yeah. 
 
C.J.
I'm sorry. I heard Leo was here, I assumed you were awake. 
 
BARTLET
I am. 
 
C.J.
I haven't seen you all day, I just... wanted to apologize for the gaffe at the briefing 
last night.
 
BARTLET
You fixed it this afternoon, right?
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
BARTLET
Then let's move on.
 
C.J.
I do apologize, sir.
 
BARTLET
No need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not eager, to 
move on.
 
There’s another knock. Sam and Toby enter.
 
SAM
Mr. President?
 
BARTLET
How you doin’?
 
SAM
You were sleeping?
 
BARTLET
Not for a little while now.
 
SAM
This is... I say, this is great, Mr. President, because usually you have a hard time 
getting to sleep before one or two. 
 
BARTLET
Not tonight.
 
SAM
That's got to feel good.
 
BARTLET
Guys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now.
 
JOSH
[enters] Good evening, Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Josh walking in the door wasn't even close. 
 
JOSH
How you doing, tonight?
 
BARTLET
I'm fine, thanks. How you doing?
 
JOSH
Good! I gave Joey Lucas a coffee mug. She doesn't know anybody here and she's already 
working hard. She's very committed. I think I did the right thing.
 
BARTLET
See, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right outside my 
bedroom door...
 
SAM
Mr. President, after a day of meetings, are you any closer to a decision on drugs?
 
BARTLET
I'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime, everybody calm 
down. Leo’s got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's fine. Keep them 
there. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them, move on. Kiefer's 
numbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my life. We do 
this right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day. 
 
JOSH
We should go and leave you now.
 
BARTLET
You guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.
 
All chuckle.
 
SAM
Sir, something has come up and frankly, it's got me as hot as a pistol. Apparently....
 
JOSH
Sam. 
 
SAM
We can talk about this tomorrow.
 
BARTLET
Everybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.
 
LEO
That's me.
 
BARTLET 
[to Leo] She was doing her job. C.J.?
 
C.J.
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
So was Danny.
 
C.J.
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Good night.
 
Everyone says their good nights. Sam, Josh, and C.J. leave.
 
TOBY
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
We were almost done.
 
TOBY
I... met with Congresswoman Wyatt today.
 
BARTLET
When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?
 
TOBY
No, sir.
 
BARTLET
Sometimes I call my wife, Dr. Bartlet.
 
TOBY
I call her Andy or uh... Andrea.
 
BARTLET
Okay. 
 
TOBY
Mandatory Minimums.
 
BARTLET
You're whupped, my friend.
 
TOBY
Sir. 
 
BARTLET
No, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've been saying 
no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family.
 
TOBY
You call your wife “Dr. Bartlet”?
 
BARTLET
Just for the turn-on.
 
Leo smirks.
 
TOBY
Uh... the thing is, she's right.
 
BARTLET
Andy. 
 
TOBY
Mandatory Minimums are considerably higher for crack than for powder cocaine.
 
BARTLET
Yes. 
 
TOBY
The vast majority of crack users are black. The vast majority of drug users are white. 
The Mandatory Minimums are racist. 
 
BARTLET
Yes, they are.
 
TOBY
It should be part of the discussion.
 
BARTLET
And it will be.
 
TOBY
Good... uh... good night.
 
BARTLET AND LEO
Good night.

Toby leaves. 

BARTLET
[to Leo] I'm sleeping better. [beat] When I sleep, I dream about a great discussion 
with experts and ideas and diction and energy and honesty. And when I wake up, I think, 
"I can sell that."
 
LEO
Good night, Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Good night.
 
Leo shuts off the room lights and closes the doors. Bartlet shuts off his bed lamp and 
goes back to bed.

Transcript By: Susan Chang

West Wing S01E21
While President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and his staff nervously await the results of a poll to determine his favorability rating, he begins a heady transfer of ambassadors and members of the Federal Election Commission designed to kickstart campaign finance reform and defuse an embarrassing incident overseas. Specifically, wheeler-dealer Bartlet recalls the married ambassador to Bulgaria, Ken Cochran (Lawrence Pressman) who is discovered to be romancing the daughter of the country's Prime Minister, but faces another crisis at home when Sam (Rob Lowe) is photographed by a newspaper giving a graduation gift to known call girl (Lisa Edelstein). Meanwhile, C.J. (Allison Janney) anxiously paces the White House corridors and wonders if she is being marginalized by Leo (John Spencer) for past mistakes. In addition, Josh (Bradley Whitford) clashes with opinionated pollster Joey Lucas (Marlee Matlin).

TEASER

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Opening shot of a clock on the wall: 7:05. The camera pans down to Donna and Josh 
walking through.

DONNA
They got to start the poll, Josh. It’s 7:05.

JOSH
It’s ten to seven.

DONNA
No, it’s really not.

JOSH
It’s 7:05?

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
That’s ridiculous.
 
DONNA
I’m not making it up.
 
JOSH
My watch says ten to seven.
 
DONNA
That’s ‘cause your watch sucks.
 
JOSH
My watch is fine.
 
DONNA
Your watch says ten to seven.
 
JOSH
How do I know it isn’t ten to seven?
 
DONNA
‘Cause those large clocks on the wall that are run by the U.S. Navy, say your watch 
sucks. In fact, they say your watch sucks in four different time zones.
 
Josh and Donna pass by C.J.’S OFFICE. Toby is razzing C.J. 
 
TOBY
Question six is asymmetrical.
 
C.J.
Question six is fine.
 
TOBY
"Would you say things in this country are going in the right direction or do you think 
they’ve gotten off on the wrong track?"
 
Josh and Donna double back to C.J.’S office and stand at the door.
 
JOSH
He’s got a good point about this.
 
C.J.
No, he doesn’t.
 
DONNA
Guys, you know it’s five after seven.
 
TOBY
Should be right direction or wrong direction.
 
C.J.
Toby. 
 
TOBY
Direction and track are two different words!
 
C.J.
Thank you, Funk and Wagnall’s. 

They all leave C.J.’s office. Bonnie and Ginger are with them.
 
TOBY
What’d she call me?
 
GINGER
Funk and Wagnall’s. They make the dictionary.
 
TOBY
I know who Funk and Wagnall’s are.
 
BONNIE
They why’d you ask her?
 
Everyone starts heading out into the HALLWAY.
 
DONNA
Guys, it’s five after seven.
 
TOBY
The question is asymmetrical.
 
C.J.
That may be so, but the question originated 2 decades ago and has proven to be a 
consistent predictor of a voter’s potential behavior. So it stays the way it is. 
 
JOSH
I have a problem with fourteen.
 
C.J.
What’s your problem?
 
JOSH
"When making policy decisions, do you think that President Bartlet puts the needs of 
average people first?" "Average people" is a pejorative phrase and occurs about six 
times in the polling model. 
 
C.J.
This may come as a shock to you, but 80% of the people in this country would use the 
word "average" to describe themselves. They do not find the term deprecating. Indeed, 
being considered an "average American" is something they find to be positive and 
comforting.
 
They all walk into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Leo, Larry, Ed and several other staffers are 
inside. Leo is reading a piece of paper. Toby sits next to him.
 
LEO
C.J. 
 
C.J.
Yes. 
 
LEO
[reads] "Jed Bartlet cares about people like me."
 
C.J.
Leo, we went over this.
 
TOBY
We need to talk about the asymmetry of question six.
 
C.J.
We really don’t.
 
TOBY
Since when are you an expert on language?
 
C.J.
In polling models?
 
TOBY
Okay. 
 
C.J.
1993. Since when are you an uptight pain in the ass?
 
TOBY
Since long before that.
 
LEO
"Jed Bartlet cares about people like me. Agree or disagree?"
 
C.J.
Again, we went over this.
 
LEO
Can’t "people like me", when read off the script, be taken to mean people like the 
interviewer? 
 
ED
When we ask that question, we usually say, "People like yourself." 
 
LARRY
Or "people like you."
 
ED
I’ve seen it both ways.
 
LEO
Fellas. 
 
LARRY
"Yourself" is a little softer.
 
ED
And softer is bad?
 
LARRY
Softer is better.
 
LEO
But the point is....
 
C.J.
The respondent isn’t confused by the question and separating the respondent from the 
interviewer with "people like yourself" is pejorative. So, Ed, Larry, you can take this 
up with Josh. Leo, Eastern Standard Time is sitting down to dinner. The poll is fine. 
 
JOSH
It’s an important poll, C.J.
 
C.J.
I’m aware of its importance. I’m also aware that if we don’t start the phone banks 
right now, I might not have enough time to leak the internals to media outlets before 
we hit the weekend.
 
TOBY
There’s still the matter...
 
C.J.
So, it turns out that over the last 3 weeks we managed to climb out of the hole, only 
we can’t tell anybody about it ‘til Monday, cause we stood here all night arguing about 
asymmetry! [sighs] It’s time.
 
LEO
Anybody want to make a prediction?
 
ED
We’ll hold at 42% job approval.
 
LARRY
We’ll hold steady.
 
JOSH
I’ll be happy if we hold steady.
 
TOBY
We’ll drop a few points, but it’ll be inside the plus or minus. 
 
LEO
C.J.? 
 
C.J.
We’re going to go up five points.
 
LEO
The President thinks we’re going to hold steady.
 
C.J.
The President is wrong.
 
LEO
You think?
 
C.J.
Yes. 
 
LEO
Let’s find out. Toby, tell Sam to start the banks.
 
Toby picks up the phone and pushes a button. 
 
CUT TO: INT. PHONE BANKS - NIGHT 
Sam and Mandy are standing wait. Sam’s cell phone rings.
 
SAM 
[into phone] Sam Seaborn... Okay. [to Mandy] Let’s get our report card.
 
Mandy walks inside the phone bank area.
 
MANDY
Okay! Here we go!
 
SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT
MONDAY NIGHT
3 HOURS INTO POLLING
Sam appears. Ginger and Bonnie are inside.
 
GINGER
Hey, Sam.
 
SAM
Hey, Ginger.
 
BONNIE
How’s it going in there?
 
SAM
I popped Mandy with my tranquilizer gun. She’s doing fine.
 
GINGER
Bonnie wanted to know why it takes 48 hours.
 
SAM
We need 1500 responses.
 
BONNIE
It takes 30 people, 48 hours to make 1500 calls?
 
SAM
It takes them about 12 hours to make 1500 calls. We need 1500 responses, which means 
we need to make 6000 calls. 
 
TOBY
[enters] Sam. 
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
BONNIE
Only 1 in 4 people don’t hang up?
 
SAM
That’s if you’re lucky.

Toby and Sam enter TOBY’S OFFICE. Sam shuts the door.
 
TOBY
The G.W. Law School graduation is tomorrow.
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
Were you going to go see your friend?
 
SAM
Laurie? 
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
SAM
I wish you’d call her Laurie.
 
TOBY
Were you going to see her graduate Law School tomorrow?
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
You can’t.
 
SAM
Okay. 
 
TOBY
I really do believe Steve Onorato knows and he’s...
 
SAM
Yeah. 
 
TOBY
He’ll try and use it to embarrass us.
 
SAM
Okay. 
 
TOBY
They may know who this girl is. They know she’s graduating Law School tomorrow. They know 
it’s someplace you’ll likely to be. Maybe they’ll want to snap a picture. Maybe...
 
SAM
Laurie. 
 
TOBY
What? 
 
SAM
You called her "this girl."
 
TOBY
Sam, you can’t.
 
SAM
I said okay, Toby. Do you see me arguing with you?
 
TOBY
No. 
 
SAM
Anything else?
 
TOBY
Nope. 
 
SAM
Biggest day of her life. Huge day. She put herself through Law School and I know that 
there are people in South Carolina that don’t like how she did it.
 
TOBY
Not just South Carolina, Sam.
 
SAM
Then in both Carolinas, Toby. Though, I never understood what the hell business it is...
 
TOBY
You can’t go, Sam.
 
SAM
I’m not going.
 
TOBY
Thank you.
 
Sam leaves.
 
CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Margaret comes in and closes the door. Leo is inside.
 
MARGARET
Leo.
 
LEO
Is he here?
 
MARGARET
Yeah.
 
LEO
Wait in here for a minute, then go back out and send him in.
 
MARGARET
Okay. Why do you want me to wait in here?
 
LEO
Cause I do.
 
MARGARET
Okay. [waits a little] It feels weird not doing anything.
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
MARGARET waits a bit longer, looking around the room.
 
MARGARET
It feels weird, you know, ‘cause the instinct...

LEO
Okay! Go out and send him in.

MARGARET
Okay. [leaves]
 
Leo gets up to greet his guest, BARRY HASKEL.
 
LEO
Barry. 

BARRY HASKEL
Yes. 
 
LEO
Leo McGarry.
 
BARRY
Barry Haskel.
 
LEO
Good to meet you.
 
BARRY
Mm-hmm.
 
LEO
Is this your first time in the White House?
 
BARRY
This is my first time in the West Wing.

LEO
You’ve been on the Federal Election Commission for nine years and no one has ever invited 
you to the White House?

BARRY
Not to the West Wing. There have been... I go to the annual Christmas party at the O.E.O.B. 
and the last Christmas the Vice President stopped in for a moment and it was very nice. 
 
LEO
Barry. [motions for Barry to sit]
 
BARRY
Mm-hmm. [sits down]
 
LEO
I wanted to talk to you about Campaign Finance Reform and specifically soft money 
contributions.
 
BARRY
Right. I had a hunch. Could I possibly have a glass of fruit juice?
 
LEO
Are you thirsty?
 
BARRY
I’ll be perfectly honest, Mr. McGarry. This is the first time I’ve been called to the 
office of the White House Chief of Staff.
 
LEO
You’re a little nervous.
 
BARRY
You know you walk past a dress Marine when you come in here? 
 
LEO
Rodney. 
 
BARRY
I didn’t catch his name, but...
 
LEO
Rodney’s great. [calls] Rodney! 
 
RODNEY
[enters] Yes, Mr. McGarry.
 
LEO
Could you do that thing you were doing before? 
 
Barry raises a hand to decline. Rodney goes through a little drill with his rifle, ending 
with a loud thump that makes Barry jump a little.

LEO
Thanks, Rodney.

RODNEY
Anytime sir. [leaves]

LEO
It’s amazing, and that rifle’s really loaded, too.

BARRY
Mr. McGarry.

LEO
Call me Leo.

BARRY
Leo. 

LEO
There’s no need to be nervous, Barry. We know you’re one of us.

BARRY
I’m sorry?
 
LEO
I say, we know you’re one of us. Six Commissioners on the F.E.C. Two just resigned, leaving 
four, including you. The belief has always been that none of the four of you favor a ban on 
soft money contributions. But the truth is, you do. 
 
BARRY
That’s not true.
 
LEO
Yes, it is. And the way that I know that it is is cause you said so. You said so to the 
Newark Star Ledger on March 13, 1995, "Money isn’t speech." And you said so two years before 
that to the Detroit Free Press, "We must reverse the 1978 Regulatory decision allowing soft 
money." 
 
BARRY
Those quotes were anonymous.
 
LEO
Not anymore.
 
BARRY
I gave those quotes on the condition of anonymity.
 
LEO
Hey, I know how you feel. I went to drug rehab on the condition of anonymity. Maybe you 
read about it in the papers. 
 
BARRY
Look. 
 
LEO
Barry, Barry! You want to ban soft money. You’re one of us. You’ve been outed.
 
BARRY
It never made much... being out numbered 5 to 1 on the F.E.C.... it never made much sense 
to me to swim against the grain. I would’ve been...
 
LEO
I understand.
 
BARRY
I would’ve been irrelevant. It made...
 
LEO
Plus, you would’ve had a hard time getting re-upped by the Senate when your term expired.
 
BARRY
Exactly!
 
LEO
On the other hand, if we hadn’t gone out and found ya, you probably never would have been 
invited to the White House.
 
BARRY
See now... when I got the call from your office, my wife and her friends said this is what 
was going to happen.

LEO
What’s that?

BARRY
That you were going to use the trappings of the White House. That there was going to be a 
sort of, um... intimidation. 

LEO
No one’s intimidating you, Barry. You’re with us. You were wandering for years in the 
darkness, but we came and found ya. And welcome back to the pack.
 
BARRY
Coercion, then? And I notice that I’m sitting here, in the Chief of Staff’s office and with 
all the trappings of the White House...
 
LEO 
[chuckling] Barry.
 
BARRY
...and my wife and her friends say it’s not uncommon for people to get light-headed, and 
star struck, and I’ve heard the same thing from other people.
 
LEO
Nonsense. Let me show you around the place. [gets up from his chair]
 
BARRY
If I could just get a glass of water.
 
LEO
No problem, we keep it in here. 
 
Leo opens door to THE OVAL OFFICE. He and Barry enter. Bartlet is with some guests and 
they’re all sharing a good laugh.
 
LEO
Mr. President, I’m so sorry to interrupt.
 
BARTLET
Not at all, we’re just having a nightcap.
 
LEO
I’d like you to meet Barry Haskell from the F.E.C.
 
BARTLET
Oh, may I present Treasury Secretary, Kenneth...
 
KENNETH
Ken Kato, how are you?
 
BARTLET
Mr. Attorney General.
 
DAN
Dan Larson.
 
BARTLET
Our CIA Director, Rob Conrad.
 
ROB
It’s good to see you.
 
They each shake hands with Barry.
 
BARTLET
Barry, I’m Jed Bartlet. I understand you’re thinking about helping us out. It makes me 
so happy. [shakes Barry’s hand]
 
BARRY
It’s an honor to meet you, Sir.
 
BARTLET
Well, let’s get him a drink.
 
Barry tries to wave off the offer.
 
LEO 
[to Barry] They’ll take good care of you. [turns to go back to his office]
 
BARTLET
Leo... [walks towards Leo]
 
ROB [OS]
Come on, sit down and have a drink with us.
 
Bartlet and Leo stand near the door, whispering.

LEO
Just put him in the boat.
 
BARTLET
This could all be for nothing.
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
BARTLET
I mean, if the numbers... [points downward]
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
BARTLET
Did we start?
 
LEO
We put the polling in the field 3 hours ago.
 
BARTLET
All right. Did the guys make any predictions?
 
LEO
No, I didn’t ask.

BARTLET
Yes, you did. 

LEO
They think we’re going to hold at 42. Toby thinks we drop a few points but inside the margin.
 
BARTLET
It could be worse.
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
BARTLET
I mean it could be worse than holding at 42.
 
LEO
Yeah. 
 
BARTLET
‘Cause if these numbers keep going down, I’m just a guy with Barry Haskell in his office.
 
LEO
I’ll stop back in ten minutes.
 
BARTLET
A dress Marine guarding your door?
 
LEO
Too showy?
 
BARTLET
Nah... My thing is, what’s he suppose to be guarding right now? 
 
LEO
I’ll be right in here. [points to his office]
 
BARTLET
Thanks. 
 
LEO
Thank you, Mr. President. [heads back into his office]
 
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
We see Laurie and her friend, JANEANE, sitting at a long table with books scattered about.
 
JANEANE
You are graduating tomorrow and...
 
LAURIE
Shhhhh...
 
JANEANE 
[lowers voice] You’re graduating tomorrow...
 
LAURIE
Janeane.
 
JANEANE
...and yet, you’re in a library studying.
 
LAURIE
There’s something called the Bar Exam.
 
JANEANE
Oh, are you taking it tonight?

LAURIE
No...
 
JANEANE
Well, then let’s go out.
 
LAURIE
Just give me ten more minutes.
 
A cell phone rings.
 
JANEANE
Oh god, is that me?
 
LAURIE
That’s me. [rummages in her bag]
 
JANEANE
See the advantages of being a waitress?
 
LAURIE
You don’t have to take the Bar Exam?
 
JANEANE
That’s right.
 
LAURIE
You’re not going to be a waitress forever.
 
JANEANE
Answer your phone.
 
LAURIE
[into phone] Hello.
 
SAM [VO]
Are you in the library?
 
LAURIE
It’s you.
 
CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam is in his office. 
 
SAM
You’re in the library the night before?
 
LAURIE [VO]
3 years of Law school. I do not understand real estate.
 
SAM
Nobody does. Listen...
 
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
 
LAURIE
You can’t come tomorrow.
 
SAM [VO]
No.
 
LAURIE
I understand.
 
SAM
There’s a reason to believe a staffer in the Majority Leader’s office knows about you. 
He knows that I know you and he’s probably known the information for some time, but is 
waiting for the moment when the information can cause the most trouble. 
 
LAURIE
And that moment’s now?
 
SAM [VO]
Yeah.
 
LAURIE
It’s okay.
 
SAM
No, it’s not okay, but...
 
LAURIE [VO]
Baby, don’t guilt yourself over this. I know you’ll be thinking about me.
 
SAM [VO]
I will. You go knock ‘em dead, tomorrow.
 
LAURIE
Okay.
 
SAM [VO]
Okay.

LAURIE
[hangs up] He can’t make it.
 
JANEANE
Yeah, I kinda guessed.
 
LAURIE
Don’t worry about it.
 
JANEANE
That’s right. It’s your week.

Sam enters. Bonnie and Ginger are inside.
 
SAM
You know what’s fun?
 
BONNIE
What?
 
SAM
The Potomac in the morning.
 
GINGER
Yeah?
 
SAM
Jogging around the Potomac or sculling. 
 
GINGER
Were you jogging this morning? [hands Sam a cup of coffee]
 
SAM
No. 
 
BONNIE
Were you sculling?
 
SAM
No. I was sitting on a bench having a bagel, but from where I was, both jogging and 
sculling looked good to me. 
 
Sam goes into his office as Toby comes out of his office.

TOBY
Bonnie.

BONNIE
Yeah.

TOBY
I need you to arrange a meeting with Ross Kassenbach.

BONNIE
For when?

TOBY
As soon as possible. Also, I need the next two minutes the President’s got.
 
SAM
[pops out of his office] Found one?
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
SAM
What? 
 
TOBY
Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
 
SAM
Is that a real country?
 
TOBY
Yup. 
 
SAM
The Federated States of Micronesia?
 
TOBY
Yes. 
 
SAM
‘Cause it sounds like a place the Marx brothers would...
 
TOBY
Real country.
 
BONNIE
Toby.
 
TOBY
Yeah. 
 
BONNIE
The President’s got two minutes in about two minutes.
 
TOBY

Toby takes off. Sam hurries after him.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and C.J. are walking and enter through the colonnade to the residence. 
Charlie is inside.
 
BARTLET
Based on what?
 
C.J
Sir. 

BARTLET
Based on what is he making that claim?
 
C.J.
Based on the memo....
 
BARTLET
We’ve been out there for three weeks.
 
CHARLIE
Good morning, Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Good morning, Charlie.
 
C.J.
Morning. 

C.J. high fives Charlie as she walks by. C.J. and Bartlet enter THE OVAL OFFICE.
 
BARTLET
We’ve been... we’ve been out there for three weeks. Crossfire, Meet the Press, Charlie 
Rose, The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning Scottsdale...
 
C.J.
Sir. 
 
BARTLET
...Time, Newsweek, Popular Mechanics. We’ve been out there saying we’re not talking about 
legalization. We are talking about treatment.
 
C.J.
There’s a memo. It’s the same memo that’s been generated by every administration for 
thirty years.
 
BARTLET
Well, how do you want to handle it?
 
C.J.
By saying it’s the same that’s been generated by every administration for thirty years. 
 
BARTLET
I don’t know. It sounds like we’re soft on the issue.
 
Toby and Sam enter.
 
TOBY
Good morning, Mr. President.
 
SAM
Good morning, sir. 
 
BARTLET
Steve Onorato is saying I want to legalize drugs. 
 
SAM
That’s the exact same memo that’s been generated by every administration for thirty years.
 
C.J.
That’s...
 
TOBY
C.J., that’s exactly what you should say.
 
C.J.
Thanks.
 
BARTLET
Hmmm... Leo was in here last night. He said you guys predicted we’d hold steady at 42. 
Were you just being optimistic or you really think we held our ground. 
 
TOBY
I said we might drop a couple, but inside the margin.
 
SAM
I think we held our ground.
 
C.J.
I didn’t say that sir.
 
BARTLET
Sorry? 
 
C.J.
I didn’t say we’d hold steady at 42, Mr. President. I said we’d gain five points. 
 
BARTLET
Yeah? 
 
C.J.
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Well, okay. Anybody want to offer C.J. the odds? 

Everyone keeps quiet. 

BARTLET
[to C.J.] Talk to the press.
 
C.J.
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Tell them every administration for the past thirty years has generated that memo.
 
C.J.
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
That’s it.
 
C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves] 

BARTLET
[closes the door] Thank you. [to Toby and Sam] What do you got?
 
TOBY
The Federated States of Micronesia.
 
SAM
Toby says it’s a country.
 
BARTLET 
[sits down with a cup of tea] It is a country. You know where?
 
TOBY
I assume it’s a small island in the South Pacific.
 
BARTLET
It’s actually 607 small islands in the South Pacific. Interestingly, while its total 
land mass is only 270 square miles, it occupies more than a million square miles of the 
Pacific Ocean. Population is 127,000 and the U.S. Embassy is located in the state of 
Pohnpei and not, as many people believe, on the island of Yap.
 
TOBY
Why would a person have that information at their disposal? 
 
BARTLET
Parties.
 
TOBY
Uh sir.
 
BARTLET
I looked at the Federated States of Micronesia. I can’t fire our ambassador.
 
TOBY
Why not?
 
BARTLET
Somebody’s going to ask me why I fired him and I’m not gonna be able to come up with 
the answer they’re looking for.
 
TOBY
Well, Sam’s got you covered.
 
BARTLET
How? 
 
SAM
You’re not going to fire the ambassador. You’re going to promote him.
 
BARTLET
To what?
 
SAM
Ambassador to Paraguay.
 
BARTLET
And what happens to the ambassador of Paraguay?
 
SAM
You make him ambassador to Bulgaria.
 
BARTLET
Hey, I like this. Of course, if everybody keeps moving up one, then I get to go home.
 
SAM
The Bulgarian ambassador is believed to be having an affair with the daughter of Prime 
Minister, Toder Lukanov.
 
BARTLET
That ambassador is Ken Cochran, isn’t it?
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
He’s having an affair with the daughter of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
 
TOBY
Who, the State Department, is saying is upset.
 
BARTLET
I can imagine.
 
SAM
Do you know him, sir?
 
BARTLET
Prime Minister of Bulgaria?
 
SAM
Ambassador Cochran.
 
BARTLET
I know his wife.
 
SAM
Ouch. 
 
BARTLET
I got to fire Ken Cochran?
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
All right, then I don’t want it to be because of the girl.
 
SAM
Why not?
 
BARTLET
I know his wife.
 
TOBY
We can create legitimate grounds for incompetence.
 
BARTLET
Well, it looks to me like there are legitimate grounds for incompetence, but... come up 
with different ones, would you? 
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
All right, let’s do it.
 
TOBY and SAM
Thank you, sir. [both leave]
 
BARTLET
Charlie!
 
CHARLIE
[enters] Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
I need to meet with Ambassador Cochran. He can be found in his office at the U.S Embassy 
in Bulgaria, or not. Either way, I’d like the State Department to put his ass on a plane 
and have it in this office tomorrow. 
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Thank you.
 
CHARLIE
Is that Ken Cochran, Mr. President?
 
BARTLET
Yeah. 
 
CHARLIE
Okay.
 
BARTLET
What? 
 
CHARLIE
I’m sorry, sir?
 
BARTLET
It looked like when I said "Ken Cochran", that you knew who he was.
 
CHARLIE
No sir.
 
BARTLET
Okay. 
 
CHARLIE
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]
 
CUT TO: INT. JOEY’S OFFICE AREA - DAY
Josh and Joey are arguing. Kenny interprets.
 
JOSH
They might put it on the table.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
They won’t put it on the table.
 
JOSH
They might...
 
JOEY [KENNY]
They won’t. [pushes Kenny aside]
 
JOSH
I’m saying if they do put it on the table...

JOEY [KENNY]
They won’t.
 
JOSH
Is there any possibility you’re going to let me finish a sentence? Is there any chance 
at all that that’s going to happen?
 
JOEY [KENNY]
You don’t have to raise your voice to me.
 
JOSH
How the hell do you know if I’m raising my voice to you?
 
JOEY
I guessed! [smirks]
 
JOSH
You’re here to give me a counter argument on English as the official language of the 
United States. You are not here to speculate on whether or not the Republicans are going 
to put the issue on the table.
 
JOEY
Okay! 
 
JOSH
Good! 

Joey signs something to Kenny. 

JOSH
What’d she say?
 
KENNY
They won’t.
 
JOSH
Okay, look...
 
DONNA
[stops by] Josh. 
 
JOSH
What? 
 
DONNA
You wanted me to let you know when C.J. started talking about the drug memo.
 
JOSH
C.J. started the briefing already?

DONNA
A half hour ago.

JOSH
The briefing is not supposed to start ‘til eleven.
 
DONNA
Guess what?
 
JOSH
My watch sucks?
 
DONNA
Yes, indeed.
 
JOSH 
[to Joey] Okay, I’ll be back and when I get back, you’re going to argue with me and we’re 
going to argue about the things I want to argue about and you’re going to do your best not 
to annoy me so much. 
 
JOEY [KENNY]
It’s almost hard to believe you’re not married. 
 
JOSH
Oh-ho-ho! [shakes head] Many have tried.
 
Josh and Donna walk off.
 
JOSH
Did Toby find a country?
 
DONNA
The Federated States of Micronesia.
 
JOSH
Is that a real country?
 
DONNA
Yes, it’s located 2500 miles southwest of Hawaii where you’ve never taken me.
 
JOSH
When was I supposed to take you to Hawaii?
 
DONNA
Anytime. It’s something bosses do.
 
JOSH
The Federated States of Micronesia.
 
DONNA
They have some of the best scuba diving in the world.
 
JOSH
Okay. 
 
DONNA
The Mantas, for instance, on the island of Yap, are prized among those who...
 
They enter JOSH’S OFFICE.
 
JOSH
Stop talking, now. [turns on TV]
 
C.J. [T.V.]
...with the point being that the Mandatory Minimum sentencing guide lines apply to crack 
cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine are fairly transparently racist. 
 
DONNA
A guy takes his assistant on a quick trip to Maui. It’s not like unheard of.
 
JOSH
Shhhh...
 
CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is doing the briefing.
 
REPORTER
C.J.
 
C.J.
Hang on, Mandatory Minimums requires a federal judge to sentence anyone convicted of 
possessing five grams of crack to at least five years in prison. It takes 100 times as 
much powder cocaine and 20 times as much heroine to get that sentence. 70% of all drug 
users are white. 80% of crack users are black. Federal Mandatory Minimums for crack 
users are a war on the black community. 
 
Clamoring for C.J.
 
C.J.
Danny. 
 
DANNY
Is the White House making a crusade on defending the rights of drug users?
 
C.J.
Oh please. Katie, you have a question.
 
KATIE
Do you have any...?
 
DANNY
Hang on C.J. I was asking...

C.J.
The White House is committed to reversing the devastating affects of drug abuse in our 
society. We believe the best way to do that is to treat drug addiction as what the AMA 
has said it is, which is a medical problem. We do not believe in a phony war on drugs. 
The chief accomplishment of which would be to either kill or incarcerate black drug users. 
 
REPORTER
C.J., are you aware that Steve Onorato...
 
C.J.
Steve Onorato is saying the White House supports legalization? 
 
REPORTER
Yes.
 
C.J.
How surprising that in the midst of an important debate the President would be accused 
of being soft on drugs. Steve Onorato has a memo written by the Assistant Surgeon General. 
I’d be happy to produce similar memos written for every President in the last thirty years, 
including four Republicans. That’s all, thank you everybody.
 
More clamoring for C.J. as she leaves the podium. Danny rushes after her into the HALLWAY.
 
DANNY
Hi. There wasn’t, I don’t think, a huge reason to snap at me.
 
C.J.
It was a ridiculous question.
 
DANNY
No, it wasn’t.
 
C.J.
Is the White House crusading for the rights of drug users? You know that’s not what I meant.
 
DANNY
I do know that’s not what you meant, but I don’t count on everybody always understanding 
what the hell comes out of your mouth, when I can’t even do it half the time.
 
C.J.
Oh, so you were just helping out.
 
DANNY
Yes, and you can’t stay pissed at me forever.
 
C.J.
Let’s find out.
 
DANNY
Mandy’s thing went away, C.J. You see anybody writing about it? You hear anybody talking 
about it? Is there really a need to continue punishing me for something I...?
 
C.J.
Hang on. 
 
They stay silent until they walk into C.J.’S OFFICE. Danny is at C.J.’s heels as she 
closes the door.
 
C.J.
They talk about it here, Danny. They talk about it here.
 
DANNY
And they blame you?
 
C.J.
They don’t say it.
 
DANNY
But they blame you.
 
C.J.
Yes. 
 
DANNY
And you think you’ve let them down.
 
Knock on the door. Carol pops her head in.
 
CAROL
C.J., you’re late for the G-7 briefing.
 
C.J. 
[to Danny] I have to go back to work.
 
DANNY
Okay. [leaves]
 
CAROL
C.J? 
 
C.J.
Call the phone banks, check in with the poll.
 
CAROL
I checked in with the poll half hour ago.
 
C.J.
Check again. [leaves her office]

Hey.

The lid is on.
 
LEO
You told me.

Hmm?

You called me an hour ago and told me it was a full lid.
 
C.J.
Yeah... I’m going to the phone banks to check in with the poll.
 
LEO
Okay. 
 
C.J.
Leo, this is a small thing and I hate to bring it up.
 
LEO
What? 
 
C.J.
I was in with the President this morning, AND he mentioned that you told him that when 
you asked for predictions, everyone said we’d hold steady at 42. 
 
LEO
Yeah? 
 
C.J.
But, I didn’t say that. I said we’d go up five points.
 
LEO
I meant in general, on average.
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
LEO
C.J., like lopping off the score from the East German judge.
 
C.J.
Leo, it wasn’t woman’s intuition. I think it’s strange....
 
LEO
Don’t read too much into it.
 
C.J.
I’m saying its strange my take wasn’t...
 
LEO
I’m saying don’t read too much into it.

JOSH
Theodore Roosevelt said...
 
JOEY
Josh! 
 
JOSH
Let me tell you what Theodore Roosevelt said.
 
JOEY
Okay. 
 
JOEY [KENNY]
What do I care what Theodore Roosevelt says?
 
JOSH
Because the Republicans are going to bring it up.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
The Republicans aren’t going to put it on the table. 
 
JOSH
He said, "We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language. 
For we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, and not as 
dwellers in a polyglot boarding house."
 
KENNY
What kind of boarding house?
 
JOSH
Polyglot. It means... ah... having knowledge of or speaking... 
 
JOEY [KENNY]
I know what ‘polyglot’ means.
 
JOSH
They why did you ask me?
 
JOEY 
[indicating Kenny]
He asked you!
 
JOSH
My point is...
 
MANDY
Will the two of you shut up, or the three of you. However many of you are talking, could 
half of you stop?
 
JOSH
Mandy’s wound a little tight during polling windows.
 
C.J.
[enters into the area] What are you all doing here?
 
JOSH
Here’s another laid-back member of our team.
 
C.J.
What are you all doing here?
 
JOSH
Mandy’s here cause she’s suppose to be. Joey’s here because Al Kiefer told her to stop by...
 
C.J.
And what are you doing here?
 
JOSH
I’m kind of in charge of morale.
 
C.J.
Josh. 
 
JOSH
The calls are going great.
 
C.J.
I’m trying to meet a deadline, Josh. I’ve got a 48-hour window and you can’t stand here 
distracting the female callers. 
 
JOSH 
[to the room] Have I been distracting the female callers? 
 
WOMEN
No. 
 
C.J.
Josh. 
 
JOSH
Not even a little bit?
 
C.J.
This is what I’m saying.
 
JOSH
The window’s fine. It’s a good response rate. They’re making their quotas. Stop bothering me.
 
C.J.
Did Josh mention he’s in charge of morale?
 
JOSH
Yes, I am. And as such, I’m going out to get coffee for everyone ‘cause a few hundred 
volts of caffeine is just what the doctor ordered around here. [to Joey] 
And you should’ve been more impressed that I was able to quote Theodore Roosevelt.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
I was impressed that you knew what ‘polyglot’ meant.

You are both drunk and disorderly.
 
LAURIE
Oh my God.
 
SAM
Happy graduation.
 
LAURIE
How did you...?
 
JANEANE
Surprise!
 
LAURIE
Janeane?

SAM
We worked in cahoots.
 
JANEANE
We did.
 
LAURIE
You planned this? This is why you dragged me back to your apartment.
 
JANEANE
Oh, are you glad that I dragged you back to my apartment? 
 
LAURIE
Yes. 
 
JANEANE
Well then, be quiet, and I’ll be upstairs.
 
Janeane takes a champagne bottle from Laurie and heads up the steps to her door.
 
SAM
Good night, Janeane.
 
LAURIE
Good night, Janeane. [to Sam] What’d you get me?
 
SAM
A graduation gift.
 
LAURIE
Is it a briefcase? Did I just ruin it? I only asked because a briefcase is the typical 
law school graduation gift, and when I said ‘typical’, I don’t mean boring. I just mean 
basic, and when I say basic, I don’t mean boring, either. 
 
Sam hands her a small long box.
 
SAM
Open the box.
 
LAURIE
You bought me a pen?
 
SAM
It’s a good one. It writes upside down and you can use that pen in outer space.
 
Laurie chuckles and closes the box.
 
LAURIE
Where’s my present?
 
Sam reaches into a bag on the steps and pulls out a briefcase. Laurie is stunned.
 
SAM
Happy graduation, counselor.
 
LAURIE
Thank you.
 
Sam hugs Laurie.
 
SAM
Way to go, Laurie.
 
LAURIE
Thank you.
 
We cut to a view through a camera viewfinder as someone takes a couple pictures of 
Sam and Laurie hugging each other.
 
SAM
I have to go. You spending the night here, or are you going to take off?

No, I’m going to go upstairs to Janeane’s. She’s got a...

Sam is waiting outside. Toby comes out of C.J.’s office. Toby and Sam head to see 
the President.
 
TOBY
He’s ready to see us.
 
SAM
What’d he say?
 
TOBY
He said, "Get your ass over here."
 
SAM
I’ve drafted a letter of resignation.
 
TOBY
Well you’re not going to give it to him, Sam, because that would deny me the pleasure 
of throwing you out through a plate glass window.
 
SAM
You have every right to say that.
 
TOBY
Thank you for acknowledging that right.
 
SAM
Toby... 
 
TOBY
I should keep you on a leash, you know that?
 
They run into Leo.
 
SAM
Leo... 
 
LEO
I’m talking to C.J., then I’m talking to you.
 
TOBY
Ten-foot chain around your neck. I bolt you to your desk and have someone come in and 
feed you.
 
CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is at her desk on the phone.
 
C.J.
[into phone] I’m going to check, but I’m almost certain the President was referring to 
the NASDAQ composite and not the 30-year Treasury yield. 
[listens] Not the DOW Industrials, the NASDAQ composite.
 
Leo barges into C.J.’s office and slams the door, startling C.J.
 
C.J. 
[into phone] Okay, someone here is going to get back to you. [hangs up]
 
LEO
How do you not tell me until this morning?
 
C.J.
Leo... 
 
LEO
How do you not call me last night?
 
C.J.
We didn’t know anything last night. [stands up]
 
LEO
Sam called you.
 
C.J.
That’s right. He met the girl and saw a suspicious car. I’m not going to call up the 
White House Chief of Staff in the middle of the night because someone started a car.
 
LEO
C.J., if it was...
 
C.J.
I was handling it, Leo. It took me three hours to confirm there was a picture, and 
another hour to find out who has it. 
 
LEO
Who has it?
 
C.J.
The London Daily Mirror. They paid a waitress friend of hers $50,000 to set it up and 
confirm that she was a call girl.
 
LEO
When is it running?
 
C.J.
It’ll run later today. American Press has it tomorrow morning. 
 
LEO
He was giving her a graduation present?
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
LEO
Work the Post and the Times.
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
Leo leaves as C.J. sits back down in her chair in relief.
 
CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - DAY
Sam, Toby, and Bartlet are walking and enter through one of the glass doors.
 
BARTLET
You never paid this girl to have sex?
 
SAM
No sir.
 
TOBY
They didn’t have that kind of relationship, sir. Except once, and that time he didn’t 
know what was happening.
 
BARTLET
Well, that makes two of us.
 
TOBY
Mr. President, Sam has always been completely above board about his relationship with Laurie.
 
BARTLET
Laurie’s the girl?
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
TOBY
He told us about it right after his first contact with her nine months ago. The fact that 
she was putting herself through law school, under circumstances that were less than good, 
has to mean something, as is the fact that Sam’s word is unimpeachable.
 
BARTLET
Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?
 
TOBY
I know it’s strange, sir. But I’m feeling a-a... certain big brotherly connection right 
now. You know, obviously, I’d like that feeling to go away as soon as possible. But for 
the moment, I think there’s no danger in the White House standing by Sam and aggressively 
going after the people who set him up.
 
Sam looks at Toby a bit stunned.
 
BARTLET
[big sigh] Sam, you’re going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel’s office 
finding out if you’ve broke any laws.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
You should also call the girl... what’s her name?
 
SAM 
Laurie.
 
BARTLET
You should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal inconvenience 
she’s about to experience.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
You might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of action against 
the paper.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
And you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney General will 
personally see to it that she’s admitted to the Bar.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Tell her the President of the United States says congratulations on getting her degree.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
That’s all.
 
SAM
Thank you, Mr. President. 
 
Sam, still stunned beyond belief, leaves THE OVAL OFFICE.
 
BARTLET
It’s nice when we can do something for prostitutes once in a while, isn’t it?
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
CHARLIE
[enters] Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Are we ready to go?
 
CHARLIE
Ambassador Cochran’s in the Mural room and Ted Mitchell’s waiting outside.
 
BARTLET
Where are we putting Lobell and his people?
 
CHARLIE
In the Roosevelt room.
 
BARTLET
He’s going to have a lot of staff with him.
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
I don’t know what any of them do, but there they are where ever Lobell goes, 14-15 guys....
 
CHARLIE
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
I’m going to take care of this first and I’ll see you across the hall.
 
TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]
 
BARTLET
Who’s in the Mural room?
 
CHARLIE
Ken Cochran.
 
BARTLET
You did it again.
 
CHARLIE
I’m sorry, sir?
 
BARTLET
When you said the name ‘Cochran’, it was like you knew him. 
 
CHARLIE
No, sir.
 
BARTLET
I have a sense about these things.
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
A finely honed sense.
 
CHARLIE
It’s failing you at the moment, sir.
 
BARTLET
Cochran’s in the Mural room?
 
CHARLIE
Yes sir.
 
BARTLET
Why don’t you go sit with him and send in Ted Mitchell.
 
CHARLIE
Yes sir.
 
BARTLET
Thank you.

SECRETARY
[enters] Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Yes, of course. [takes a pen and signs something] Thank you.
 
SECRETARY
Thank you, sir. 
 
She leaves as TED MITCHELL enters.
 
BARTLET
Ted.
 
TED MITCHELL
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Thank you for coming.
 
They hug.
 
TED
Oh, it’s my pleasure.
 
BARTLET
You’re looking good.
 
TED
Oh, I feel good.
 
BARTLET
How is Mary?
 
TED
She sends her love. [sits down]
 
BARTLET
All right, listen. I have something to do in the next room. Let me just tell you that 
I need a favor.
 
TED
Oh, of course, sir.
 
BARTLET
I need you to hire a guy.
 
TED
Who, sir?
 
BARTLET
A former ambassador to Bulgaria.
 
TED
Who is that, sir?
 
BARTLET
Ken Cochran.
 
TED
Well, isn’t Ken Cochran the current ambassador to Bulgaria?
 
BARTLET
Not for long. Look, he’s a good man, a smart man; I think he’d make a very good corporate 
officer.
 
TED
Why is he being fired, sir?
 
BARTLET
Gross incompetence. I’ll be right back.
 
He leaves a confused Ted sitting in the Office.
 
Bartlet walks through the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Nancy walks in.
 
NANCY
Good morning, sir.
 
BARTLET
Good morning, Nancy.
 
NANCY
Senator Lobell’s in the Roosevelt room.
 
BARTLET
Yeah, I’ll be right in.
 
He opens the door to THE MURAL ROOM. KEN COCHRAN and Charlie had been waiting inside. 
 
KEN COCHRAN
Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Ken. 
 
They shake hands.
 
COCHRAN
It’s good to see you again, sir.
 
BARTLET
Thank you for flying in on such short notice.
 
COCHRAN
Of course, Mr. President. What can I do for you?
 
BARTLET
Resign.
 
COCHRAN
Excuse me?
 
BARTLET
You’ve been having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister and that doesn’t 
work for me. But neither does the newspaper article saying you’re having an affair with 
the daughter of the Prime Minister. So, I need you to resign. You’re going to get a job 
offer from Ted Mitchell for a lot more money than you’re making now, that’s why you left 
the Embassy. I’ll be back in a minute.
 
Bartlet leaves. Charlie closes the door.
 
COCHRAN
Well, this is outrageous. 

He wipes his face and hands nervously with a handkerchief.

COCHRAN
This is outrageous and I’ll explain that to him when he comes back in here.
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
Have we met?
 
CHARLIE
Sir?
 
COCHRAN
You look very familiar to me. Have we met?
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
Where?
 
CHARLIE
I was a waiter at the Gramercy club.
 
COCHRAN
Charlie?
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
Charlie!
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
It’s good to see you again. [goes to shake Charlie’s hand]
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
Under strange circumstances, which when the President comes back, I’ll explain....
 
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
 
COCHRAN
I resigned my membership in that club, by the way.
 
CHARLIE
Did you?
 
COCHRAN
Oh yeah. I find exclusive clubs to be repugnant. 
 
CHARLIE
I couldn’t help but notice that didn’t stop you from joining up in the first place.
 
COCHRAN
Now, that’s out of line. That’s out of line and that shouldn’t have been said. And you’ve 
forgotten that you’re addressing an U.S. Ambassador.
 
CHARLIE
I apologize, sir.
 
COCHRAN
I’m sorry to do this, but I’d like to speak to your supervisor.
 
CHARLIE 
[looking perplexed] Well, I’m personal aide to the President, so my supervisor’s a little 
busy right now looking for a back door to this place to shove you out of. But, I’ll let 
him know you’d like to lodge a complaint.
 
BARTLET
[comes back in] Thanks for waiting.
 
COCHRAN
Mr. President. Clearly this young man, who works for you, has told you something about 
our past, and I’d like to say here and now...
 
BARTLET
It doesn’t have anything to do with... Oh, wait a second. You two have a past?
 
CHARLIE
Sir?
 
BARTLET
You mocked my finely honed sense.
 
CHARLIE
Yes sir.
 
BARTLET
You stood there in my face...
 
COCHRAN
Sir.
 
BARTLET
It’s done Ken. Ted Mitchell’s going to put you on the Board of Directors, and please 
remember that I have a lot of affection for your wife, and I would hate to see her be 
made a fool of.
 
COCHRAN
I think it would be appropriate at this time, Mr. President, to make a confession.
 
BARTLET
What’s that?
 
COCHRAN 
[smuggly] I never voted for you.
 
BARTLET
Well, thanks for trying, but here I am anyway. Got to go.
 
Bartlet leaves into the HALLWAY. He heads for THE ROOSEVELT ROOM, where Toby is waiting 
outside.
 
TOBY
All set?
 
BARTLET
Look at that. 14 staffers in there.
 
TOBY
You have quite a huge staff, too, Mr. President.
 
BARTLET
Yeah, but I don’t walk around with them, you know?
 
Both enter. MAX LOBELL is waiting inside with a number of his staffers.
 
BARTLET
Good morning.
 
MAX LOBELL
Good morning, Mr. President. Please allow me to introduce Bob Simon, Peter Rapman....
 
BARTLET
Max, I don’t need to know all the names. It’s okay. Please, sit down.
 
LOBELL
All right then.
 
BARTLET
You know what we’re doing here, right?
 
LOBELL
We’re going to talk about soft money.
 
BARTLET
We’re going to do more than talk about it.
 
LOBELL
Okay.
 
BARTLET
We agree on nothing, Max.
 
LOBELL
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Education, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes, you name it, 
we disagree.
 
LOBELL
You know why?
 
BARTLET
‘Cause I’m a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egg head, communist.
 
LOBELL
Yes, sir. And I’m a gun-totin’, redneck son-of-a-bitch.
 
BARTLET
Yes, you are.
 
LOBELL
We agree on that.
 
BARTLET
We also agree on campaign finance.
 
LOBELL
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
So, Max.
 
LOBELL
Yes, sir?
 
BARTLET
Let’s work together on campaign finance.
 
LOBELL
You don’t have the votes in the House.
 
BARTLET
I don’t need them. 1978, the FEC voted a regulatory rule that opened the door to soft 
money. The FEC can close it again with 4 of the 6 votes. We don’t need a law.
 
LOBELL
And how are you going to get the four votes?
 
BARTLET
Two seats opened up, I nominated Bacon and Calhoun.
 
LOBELL
That’s two.
 
BARTLET
Barry Haskel was with us already. We took him out of the closet. 
 
LOBELL
How are you going to get the 4th seat to open up?
 
BARTLET
Toby’s going to take care of that right away. Max, can I count on your support to confirm 
my candidates?
 
LOBELL
And what do I get in exchange?

BARTLET
[beat] The thanks of a grateful President.
 
LOBELL
Good answer, sir.
 
BARTLET 
[to Toby] Go.

Toby leaves.

BARTLET
[to Lobell] Thank you.

They shake hands.
 
CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

TOBY
[enters] Mr. Kassenbach.
 
HENRY KASSENBACH
Yeah.
 
TOBY
Hi, I’m Toby Ziegler. [shakes Kassenbach’s hand]
 
KASSENBACH
Very nice to meet you.
 
TOBY
The President thinks you’ve done an excellent job on the Federal Election Commission 
and would like to extend his warmest congratulations.
 
KASSENBACH
On what?
 
TOBY
On being named the next ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.

FADE TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
WEDNESDAY NIGHT
POLLING COMPLETE

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’s OFFICE - NIGHT
C.J. is staring out her window as Josh enters her office.
 
JOSH
It’s in.
 
C.J. turns away from the window.
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
You’ve talked to them?
 
C.J.
They sealed it in an envelope, sent it by courier.
 
JOSH
So, Joey mentioned she talked to you.
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
JOSH
She said, "You think you only have so many times left you can walk into the Oval Office 
and sing a song."
 
C.J.
She said, "Sing a song"?
 
JOSH
No, that’s what I thought she said. I’m trying to pick up some sign and right now we’re 
doing it by letters of the alphabet. So I had Kenny come over and interpret it, and it 
turns out she said "you think you only have so many times left you can come into the 
Oval Office and say you’re wrong." 
 
C.J.
He hasn’t been calling my number that much, Josh.
 
JOSH
He did on this. This last three weeks, the media strategy was yours.
 
C.J.
I know.
 
JOSH
You should listen to Joey. Holding at 42 is a good number. You shouldn’t expect a 
five-point bump.
 
C.J.
I do expect it.
 
JOSH
Okay. [beat] He thinks of you like a daughter, C.J.
 
C.J.
That’s not a good enough reason to keep me here.
 
JOSH
You’ll come as soon as you get it?
 
C.J.
Yup. 
 
JOSH
Cause we’re all waiting over there.
 
C.J.
Yeah. 
 
Josh leaves. 
 
CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT 
Bartlet, Leo, Toby, Sam, Joey, Kenny, and Mandy are all waiting.
 
LEO
They’re delivering it to her?
 
MANDY
Yeah. 
 
LEO
And she’s going to bring it right here.
 
MANDY
Yeah. 
 
LEO
Okay. 
 
Long silence as Charlie comes in. He gives Bartlet a cup of coffee.
 
BARTLET
Kassenbach was okay?
 
TOBY
I’m sorry, sir?
 
BARTLET
Kassenbach was okay?
 
TOBY
He’s gonna be an ambassador; he feels pretty good.
 
BARTLET
Did you tell him about the weather?
 
TOBY
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Scuba diving?
 
TOBY
[chuckling] Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Full diplomatic immunity?
 
TOBY
Yes sir. Though, there really aren’t a... a lot of laws in Micronesia, sir.

BARTLET
Sure.
 
JOSH
[enters] Good evening.
 
BARTLET
Good evening, Josh.
 
JOSH
I just saw C.J. She’ll be here with it in a minute.
 
LEO
Okay. 
 
JOSH
Joey and I have been working on a counter argument to Alexis de Tocqueville.
 
BARTLET
We’re having a fight with Alexis de Tocqueville?
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Mr. President, please don’t get him started.
 
JOSH
Joey, what say you to the position that with ethnic warfare spreading around the globe, 
and in particularly in Eastern Europe, it’s only a matter of time before it reaches our 
shores and making English the official language of the United States will safeguard 
against the destruction of our national identity and help us avoid ethnic strife? What 
say you to that?
 
Joey blows a big raspberry.
 
JOSH
You see that? That’s what I’ve been dealing with all week.
 
JOEY [KENNY]
Mr. President, 72% of Hispanics are strongly opposed to such a law. The Republicans will 
never put it on the table because they’ll risk losing the second largest ethnic block of 
voters in the country. But if you need a counter argument, then I’d mention to Monsieur 
de Tocqueville, over here, that aside from it being bigoted and unconstitutional, it’s 
ludicrous to think that laws need to be created to help protect the language of Shakespeare. 
 
JOSH
Okay, that’s all I was looking for, that one line. Took you four days.
 
Joey blows a big raspberry again.
 
JOSH
She did it again.
 
BARTLET
Yeah.
 
Joey sits back smugly. Another long silence.
 
BARTLET
What kind of briefcase did you get her, Sam?
 
SAM
Sir? 
 
BARTLET
What kind of briefcase?
 
SAM
Coach Beekman in British tan with brass hardware.
 
BARTLET
That’s nice.
 
SAM
Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
Andare makes a nice model. Comes in black or brown, hand stained, fit a laptop, notebooks, 
the works.
 
TOBY
This conversation is surreal.
 
BARTLET
Trieste in Milan makes a nice briefcase.

C.J. quietly enters with an envelope in her hands and makes her way across the room to 
Bartlet.
 
C.J.
Good evening, Mr. President. The full polling book is 400 pages long and it’s still 
being put together. I have the top sheet results.
 
LEO
What does it say?
 
C.J.
I was wrong. We went up nine points.
 
C.J. smiles. Leo smiles and starts to laugh, but catches himself. There are smiles all around.
 
BARTLET
Okay, what’s next?
 
LEO
We should talk about the new projections.
 
Everyone starts talking at once.

Transcript By: Susan Chang

West Wing S01E22
President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) prepares for a town hall meeting with college students while the U.S. military races to find a downed American pilot in the Iraqi desert before the Iraqi military captures him. C.J. (Allison Janney) doesn't relish the notion of misleading the press over rescue preparations. Likewise, Toby (Richard Schiff) tries to ignore updates from the distressed orbiting space shuttle which includes his brother David, a payload specialist aboard the craft which cannot close its cargo doors. Meanwhile, a huffing Josh (Bradley Whitford) is dispatched to run down and convince the wayward Vice President (Tim Matheson) to re-think his position on campaign finance reform.

TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT

	LIVE TOWN HALL MEETING 
	THE NEWSEUM 
	ROSSLYN, VIRGINIA 

In the alley behind the Newseum, there are waiting crowds and limos. 

BARTLET [VO]
Here’s another one. Two politicians are having an argument. One of them stands up and 
says, "You’re lying!" The other one answers, "Yes, I am, but hear me out." 

The audience laughs.

CUT TO: INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A monitor shot of Bartlet on stage. 

MODERATOR [VO]
Mr. President, do you have time for one more question? 

CUT TO: INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

BARTLET
I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer 
to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like the current crop of 18-25 year 
olds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In 1972, half of 
that age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is considerably less 
likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work 
on political campaigns. A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." 
So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.  

Gina is on a catwalk above the audience, talking to another Secret Service Agent.

GINA
We’re moments away. I’m going to get the door. 

BARTLET
. . .there’s a guy on my staff who showed me a report from the Center of Policy 
Alternatives that said 61% of your age group agree with the statement "Politicians 
and political officials - 

In the lobby of the Newseum. Josh, C.J. and Carol stand in the room. Reporters mill-about. 

BARTLET [VO]
- have failed my generation. When asked how older generations see you, your answers were 
"lazy", "confused," and "unfocused". 

REPORTER [OS]
What’s that source? 

JOSH
The Center of Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for the bus ride back. 

BARTLET [OS]
When asked how you see yourselves, your answers were "ambitious", "determined", and
"independent". [CUT TO: Bartlet onstage] Uh, I want to continue with this, [Bartlet
glances offstage to Charlie, who looks very happy] but there was some debate amongst
my staff earlier today as to whether or not I should take off my jacket. Some thought
that it would fit in nicely with the folksy atmosphere of a town meeting, others thought
that it wouldn’t be presidential. Can I trust you all to read nothing more into it than 
I’ve been talking for two hours and it’s a little hot under these lights? 

The audience applauds as Bartlet takes off his jacket.

Sam stands at the end of the control room, reading some notes. 

BARTLET [VO]
See all that ambition and determination doesn’t translate into political action, Suzanne. 

Bonnie walks up to Sam. 

BONNIE
Where’s Toby? 

SAM
Why? 

BONNIE
He’s got a phone call. 

SAM
From who? 

BONNIE
Peter Jobson. 

SAM
Give it to me. 

BARTLET [VO]
- that tax burden has crept further and further down the income and age ladder. And 
benefits are going more and more to the elderly and well-to-do. Totaling all payments 
to individuals...

Toby is watching Bartlet on a monitor in the lobby.

SAM
Toby? 

BARTLET [VO]
We spend nine times as much on the elderly as we do on a single child. 

Toby turns around. Sam shoots his arm up in the air in a wavy motion. Toby sighs with 
relief and turns to look over the railing to Josh standing below.

BARTLET [VO]
No wonder this upcoming generation has turned its back on a government that’s forgotten 
them. 

TOBY
Josh. [makes the wavy sign to Josh] 

Josh is at the bottom of the stairs. He gets Leo’s attention. 

JOSH
Leo.

Leo turns around, Josh makes the wavy sign.

LEO
What’s that? 

JOSH
It’s the signal. 

LEO
I thought that was the signal for the other thing? 

JOSH
It’s the signal for this thing, now. 

LEO
When did that happen? 

JOSH
It happened just... who cares, Leo? It’s the signal for this thing, now. 

LEO
So, we’re totally out of the woods? 

JOSH
Go tell the President. 

C.J. is in the Newseum Press Room, walking behind the rows of reporters. 

BARTLET [VO]
Overall entitlement payments have crowded out public investment in infrastructure and 
they will have crowded out public investment in education., to say nothing of the general 
quality of life. So college kids are facing a future of having to pay higher taxes... 

C.J. hits Danny on the back of the head on her way past him. 

C.J.
Follow me. 

DANNY
Why? 

BARTLET [VO]
Today’s young people aren’t exactly living for tomorrow.

C.J.
I have a tip. 

DANNY
You do? 

C.J.
Yes. 

DANNY
Okay. 

C.J.
I have a tip and I’m going to give it to you before the others. 

DANNY
Are we being watched? 

C.J.
No. 

DANNY
Then why are we talking like this? 

C.J.
I have news. 

DANNY
What’s the news? 

C.J.
I want you to acknowledge that I’m doing something nice for you. 

DANNY
What’s the news? 

C.J.
A peace pipe of sorts. 

DANNY
Yes. 

C.J.
An offering, in one sense. 

DANNY
What’s the damn news? 

C.J.
Call your science editor. 

DANNY
Why? 

C.J.
It’s about the Space Shuttle Columbia. 

Leo walks behind the audience. As Bartlet speaks, Leo walks up in front of a monitor and
makes "the signal" so Bartlet can see it. 

BARTLET
Generation x advocacy group third millennium, 53 of 18 to 25 year olds believe the soap 
opera General Hospital will outlast Medicare. This from a generation convinced that the 
generation before them has ransomed their generation’s future. That’s why my youngest 
daughter Zoey is always mad at me. 

The audience laughs. Zoey looks down at her father affectionately. 

BARTLET
This is the part where Zoey tries to crawl under a seat to hide. Don’t worry about it, 
sweetie, I’ll bring out the baby pictures any second now. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT
Crowds cheer on the side. Ron walks up to Gina. 

RON
Straight to the car. 

GINA
He’s not going to work the rope line? 

RON
There’s a softball game the President wants to watch. 

GINA
They show softball on TV? 

RON
Well, yeah. 

GINA
And the president watches it? 

RON
He likes to unwind by watching sports on TV. 

GINA
Softball. 

RON
Whatever’s on. 

GINA
Okay. [surveys the crowd] 

CUT TO: INT. NEWSEUM AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Charlie walks up to Josh in the back of the auditorium. 

BARTLET [VO]
Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had bothered to 
write that down. 

CHARLIE
Did you hear that? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
He used it. 

JOSH
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
He used the material I told him about. 

JOSH
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
You were right. 

JOSH
About what? 

CHARLIE
It doesn’t go away. 

BARTLET [VO]
Thank you, everyone. God bless you, and God bless America. 

JOSH
Here we go.  

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS
Gina speaks into her wrist mike.

GINA
He’s not working the rope line. Straight to the car. I’ve got Bookbag. 

Bartlet, the staff, and Zoey walk out to the limos. Gina escorts Zoey to one of the limos. 

ZOEY 
[to Gina] Baby pictures, he’s heckling me with it. And visa card bills [on her father 
walking to the crowd] And look, now he’s working the rope line. If there’s ever a chance 
he’s going to walk past a crowd of people. Charlie! 

Charlie walks up, while Gina apprehensively looks over the crowd. 

GINA 
[muttering] I saw something. 

ZOEY
By the way, Charlie apologized to me. He made a full apology. 

GINA
I saw something! 

In the crowd, a troublesome-looking young man looks up at something behind Gina’s head. 
Gina turns around in slow-motion to see what he is looking at. Her eyes widen, and she’s
just about to scream...

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

	12 HOURS EARLIER

Various military personnel are running to and fro. Leo enters and approaches Admiral 
Fitzwallace.

LEO
What’s going on? 

FITZWALLACE
One second, Leo. [into phone] That was an SA-6? Surface to air? Thank you. That was Jabar 
Air Force base in Kuwait, says a Nighthawk didn’t come back. 

LEO
Didn’t come back from where? 

FITZWALLACE
A three-hour patrol in the No-fly with the Five and Dime. 

LEO
Iraq. 

FITZWALLACE
Yeah. 

LEO
We have an F-117 down in Iraq. 

FITZWALLACE
Along with the pilot 

LEO
How much of this is confirmed?

FITZWALLACE
None of it. 

LEO
How much time? 

FITZWALLACE
I'll need ten more minutes. 

LEO
Ten minutes, and then I’m bringing in the President. 

FITZWALLACE
Confirmation in ten minutes.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE COLONNADE - DAY
Bartlet and Charlie are walking from the Residence to the Oval Office. 

BARTLET
It seems to me that if this event is over by 10:00, then I can be back here by 11, and 
you know what that means. 

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. It means that you can watch the girls’ softball game. 

BARTLET
Did you just snicker when you said that? 

CHARLIE
No, sir. 

BARTLET
Yes, you did. 

As they enter THE OVAL OFFICE, an aide hands him a memo. 

AIDE 1
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Thanks, Lou. [to Charlie] When you said Girls Softball Game, you snickered. 

CHARLIE
No, sir. 

BARTLET
Yes, you snickered. As if to indicate there was something wrong with my wanting to see a 
girls’ softball game live via satellite.

CHARLIE
Well, you seem pretty excited by it, sir. 

A knock on the door, and another aide sticks his head in. 

AIDE 2
They’re ready for you, Sir. 

BARTLET
Thanks, Phil. [to Charlie, whom he leads down the hall] I am excited about it! You come 
to the end of a long day, you sit back, you open a beer, you watch a sporting event. 
That’s what men do.

CHARLIE
Girls’ softball. 

BARTLET
If that’s what’s on, then that’s what they watch. It’s either that, or a cricket match 
between Scotland and Bermuda. Now, I am an educated man, Charlie, but when someone tries 
to explain cricket to me, all I want to do is hit him in the head with a teapot. 

AIDE 3 [OS]
Good morning, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Good morning, Patty. [to Charlie] So, it’s softball. Sacramento State versus the 
University of the Pacific.

CHARLIE
Well, that’s a clash of the Titans, sir. 

BARTLET
Now, you’re not going to spoil my fun. 

CHARLIE
I wouldn’t want to, Sir. 

BARTLET
I’m going to get back at the end of the day, sit back, open a beer...

CHARLIE
And watch girls softball. 

BARTLET
That’s right! 

They walk into the West Wing offices. Greeted by more aides.

AIDES
Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, sir. 

BARTLET
Hey, Steve. Hey, Mikey. [to Charlie] Listen, have I got any of the names right so far? 

CHARLIE
No, sir, but you came pretty damn close to a couple of them. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

Charlie and Bartlet enter THE PRESS ROOM, which is filled with aides. C.J. is inside.

BARTLET
Good morning, everybody! 

C.J. 
[pointing out the stage setup to Bartlet] I hope you don’t mind if we get right to it. 

BARTLET
Sure. 

C.J.
It’s a town hall meeting broadcast live on MSNBC. For the purposes of this rehearsal, 
Carol will be the moderator, she’ll be seated at your right, which is camera left. 
You’ll have a pitcher and a drinking glass. 

BARTLET
And when I speak, I should stand facing the audience, right? 

C.J.
Sir 

BARTLET
Do you know how I know this, C.J.? Because I’ve done it 2,000 to 300,000 times before. 
[to Sam, who just walked in] Hey, Sam. 

SAM
Yes, sir? 

BARTLET
Why didn’t the Columbia land last night? 

SAM
I’m sorry, sir? 

BARTLET
The Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night, someone told me that it didn’t. 

SAM
I don’t know, sir. 

BARTLET
Why don’t you go ask Toby? 

SAM
Why would Toby know? 

BARTLET
His brother’s on that flight. 

SAM
Really? 

BARTLET
He’s a payload specialist. 

SAM
I didn’t know that 

BARTLET
He’s up there with four red-bellied Japanese newts. He wants to see how a newt’s inner 
ears, which are remarkably similar to humans, are influenced by the absence of gravity. 
[to C.J.] Do you know what he calls them, C.J.? 

C.J.
Astro-newts? 

BARTLET
100% right. [to Sam] Go ask him why it didn’t land. 

SAM
Yes, sir. Bartlet walks up to Stage and sits on stool. C.J follows him. 

C.J.
Okay, Mr. President. 

CAROL
Mr. President, the first question is...

BARTLET
C.J., you say I have a pitcher of water and a drinking glass. Now the water gets into 
the glass how? 

CUT TO: INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Toby is pacing in front of Bonnie’s desk. 

TOBY
And the question will go something like this, Mr. President, your administration has 
pursued a policy of, what? Constructive engagement...

BONNIE
Yes. 

TOBY
...towards China, even though it’s a communist country that has systemically, what, 
imprisoned dissidents...

BONNIE
Yes. 

TOBY
Okay, oppressed blah, blah, blah. At the same time, your administration has refused to 
engage Cuba. Why the double standard? 

GINGER 
[walking by] Interesting question. 

TOBY
Thanks. 

SAM
Toby? 

TOBY
We need an answer on Cuba. We need an answer on Cuba, and we need an answer on farm loans. 

SAM
Toby, college students aren’t going to ask questions on Cuba. 

TOBY
There will be faculty there. 

SAM
You know, not only did I not know that you had a brother on the Space Shuttle right now, 
I didn’t know you had a brother. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
I didn’t know you had a brother! 

TOBY
I do. 

SAM
Do you know why the Space Shuttle didn’t land last night? 

TOBY
Why? 

SAM
Were you aware that the Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night and didn’t? 

TOBY
What do you want from me, Sam? Is there something going on on the shuttle? 

SAM
I’ll find out. 

TOBY
Thank you. And write me the answer on Cuba. 

SAM
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Josh is just getting in, and is all over the muffins and coffee. 

JOSH
Donna? 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
Did you get me the meeting with the Vice President? 

DONNA
I did, but you’re not going to be happy. 

JOSH
Jogging! 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
We couldn’t really, this time, just sit in chairs? 

DONNA
He’s jogging at 2; it’s the only time he could fit you in. 

JOSH
Okay, order me boiled chicken and some pasta. Nothing like a meeting you have to carb-up 
for. 

DONNA
You’re supposed to be at the town hall prep right now. 

JOSH 
[walking into his office] Yeah, I’m headed to the Press Room. 

DONNA [VO]
It started 10 minutes ago. 

JOSH 
[stopping behind his desk] Donna? 

DONNA 
[walking inside] Yeah? 

JOSH
Where’s my chair? 

DONNA
We have to go. 

Donna walks out of office. Josh follows her as she goes by her desk.

JOSH
Where’s my chair? 

DONNA
What chair? 

JOSH
The chair I sit in at my desk. 

DONNA
It’s at the shop. 

JOSH
At the shop? 

DONNA
You said one of the wheels was wobbly. 

JOSH
Yeah, you call up a guy in maintenance, he uses a screwdriver. 

DONNA
Well, I sent it to the shop. 

JOSH
I didn’t even know there was a shop. 

DONNA
It’s not so much a shop as it is 

JOSH
What? 

DONNA
My friend Curtis. 

JOSH
Your friend Curtis. 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
Is fixing my chair? 

DONNA
I’m throwing him some work. 

JOSH
And how much is Curtis charging the Federal Government to fix the wobbly wheel on my 
chair? 

DONNA
He said he’d have to take a look at the job. 

JOSH
At his shop. 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
Okay. 

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY

MANDY
Mr. President, there are more than 40 million Americans without health insurance, 
and a majority of them are children. In the first year of your presidency, you 
proposed no new...

BARTLET
I proposed 

MANDY
...comprehensive solution to the crisis. Can we expect real action in the future, or will 
your administration continue to nibble around the edges? 

BARTLET
I wouldn’t say my administration is nibbling around the edges. 

JOSH
Don’t repeat the phrase, sir, that will be the soundbite. If we don’t have a solution, 
the least we can do is acknowledge that there is a problem. 

BARTLET
I agree with you that far too many Americans don’t have adequate access to health 
insurance, and that far too many of them are children. Yes, we can and we must do more. 

LEO
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Hang on. [to Josh] Now can I blame Congress? 

JOSH
Knock yourself out. 

LEO
Mr. President, I need you in the situation room. 

Bartlet nods to everyone and follows Leo out.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Fitzwallace and the Joint Chiefs of Staff rise as Bartlet comes in. 

FITZWALLACE
Good morning, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Is the pilot still alive? 

FITZWALLACE
He had an ACES II 0/0 ejector seat abroad. 

ARMY OFFICER
NATO command in Brussels says the AEGIS system on the North Dakota picked up a tracking
signal on the south peninsula on the Fao Peninsula, south of Basra. 

BARTLET
He’s in the middle of nowhere. 

LEO
Who else is out there? 

ARMY OFFICER
The fourth corps of the Iraqi RG were patrolling the area. 

AIR FORCE OFFICER
Someone is within ten miles of the pilot. 

BARTLET
Our guy is ten miles from the Fourth Corps of the Iraqi Republican Guard? 

FITZWALLACE
It’s a matter of who gets there first. 

LEO
Fitz, you got a rescue scenario? 

FITZWALLACE
Yeah, the 16th special operations group out of Hubert Field. 

LEO
They use the PAVE Hawks? 

FITZWALLACE
And the MH-53J. 

LEO 
[handing Bartlet photos] These are the special equipped helicopters. They fly treetop 
altitude at about 180 knots.

PHIL
Mr. President, can I suggest that rather than jumping into a military rescue mission - 

LEO
Oh, please. 

PHIL
That a phone call to the Iraqi ambassador 

LEO
Bill, you wanna check with the embassy?

PHIL
I’m saying that three hours spent on diplomatic solutions 

LEO
I'll tell you what, Phil. How about I drop you and your 47 million-dollar warplane that’s 
already been picked up by Iraqi radar in the middle of the desert. Then you tell me if 
we’ve got three hours to find a diplomatic solution before we come and get you! 

BARTLET
What’s his name? 

FITZWALLACE
I’m sorry, sir? 

BARTLET
The pilot. What’s his name? 

FITZWALLACE
Captain Scott Hutchins. 

BARTLET
Where’s he from? 

FITZWALLACE
Rhode Island. 

BARTLET
How old is he? 

FITZWALLACE
26. 

BARTLET
Rob told me in my intelligence briefing last week that the Iraqi government has put out 
a bounty the equivalent of 14,000 dollars U.S on any American plane shot down, or any 
American soldier captured. Now, he was just patrolling the No Fly zone, right? 

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
He had not engaged. 

FITZWALLACE
No, sir. 

BARTLET
Bill, if it ends up that Fitzwallace has to call this kid’s parents, I swear to God I’m 
invading Baghdad. [to Fitzwallace] Get him back. 

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. walks into Leo’s office. 

C.J.
Yeah. 

LEO
Oh C.J., The Iraqis shot down an F-117 Nighthawk in the Southern No-Fly Zone. 

C.J.
Is the pilot still alive? 

LEO
Yeah, but he’s caught between a couple of divisions of the Republican Guard. 

C.J.
Is there a Pentagon...?

LEO
Pentagon team is coming over to brief you. 

C.J.
Is there a rescue mission? 

LEO
President gave the order about an hour ago. 

C.J.
If the Iraqis shot down an F-117, they’re going to want to tell the world about it. 

LEO
Yeah. 

C.J.
There’s going to be film of a burning airplane on CNN within two hours, and the press 
will have the news before you get done with whatever it is you’ve got going on in the 
situation room. 

LEO
Which is the problem of conducting a covert rescue mission in this age of instant news. 
You understand what I’m telling you? 

C.J.
Yes, I do. 

LEO
‘Cause there was a problem.

C.J.
Leo, I’m saying...

LEO
There was a problem a few months ago with India/Pakistan, you were uncomfortable - 

C.J.
Leo.

LEO
You were uncomfortable lying to the press...

C.J.
I wasn’t lying to the press about India/Pakistan, I was lied to by you, which made me 
look like an idiot. 

LEO
Well, I’m not lying to you now. Four Mh-53 J Pay-lows carrying 80 guys from the 16th 
special ops are out flying under radar. 

C.J.
We’re going to pay a price for misleading the press. 

LEO
I don’t care. 

C.J.
I understand. 

JOSH
[enters] Leo, an F-117? 

LEO 
[to C.J.] You should go to your briefing. 

C.J. exits.

LEO
[to Josh] Yeah. 

JOSH
An F-117 is a stealth fighter, right? 

LEO
Yeah. 

JOSH
At some point, we’re going to be talking about how they shot down a stealth fighter. 

LEO
You can take that to the bank. 

JOSH
Anyway, I arranged a meeting with Hoynes. 

LEO
When? 

JOSH
In an hour. 

LEO
Where? 

JOSH
We’re jogging. 

LEO
Listen to me. Don’t tell him why it’s bad for us. Tell him why it’s bad for him. 

JOSH
I’m not worried about the meeting. 

LEO
Come see me after. 

Josh exits into the HALLWAY and runs into Toby. They continue walking. 

TOBY
An F-117? 

JOSH
Yes. 

TOBY
How did it get seen? 

JOSH
I’m sure that someone is looking into that. 

TOBY
I would think so. 

JOSH
In it’s defense, the stealth fighter is a generation of technology behind the B-2 Spirit 
Bomber. 

TOBY
It’s a stealth fighter, it should have stealth capability, right? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

TOBY
Because if it doesn’t, we should call it something else. 

Josh snorts in agreement and veers left to his own office. Toby walks into his OFFICE,
where Sam is sitting on the front of Toby’s desk, waiting for him. 

SAM
Hello. 

TOBY
Hi. 

SAM
One of the payload bay doors would not close. 

TOBY
I’m sorry. 

SAM
Specifically the starboard payload bay door. 

TOBY
Sam, if your ass isn’t off my desk, and I mean stat...

SAM 
[getting up] This is not his first shuttle mission. It is his fourth shuttle mission, 
Dr. David Ziegler, holding postgraduate degrees in both physiology and biology. Now I 
know more about your brother than I do about you, since I didn’t know you had a brother. 

TOBY
A payload bay door wouldn’t close? 

SAM
I talked to the mission commander, guy name of Peter Jobson, he said the power drive unit 
on the starboard pay load door is jammed, they were going to need an EVA to fix it, and 
they didn’t want to land till the morning. 

TOBY
It’s morning every 45 minutes on the shuttle. 

SAM
Morning at Edwards. 

TOBY
It’s morning right now. 

SAM
The EVA’s taking them a little time. 

TOBY
Well, it’s a red-letter day for U.S. Aviation, isn’t it? 

SAM
Toby. Peter Jobson was very calm. He said it was a minor problem. 

TOBY
All right, then go back to work. C.J.’s going to need the briefing room, so let’s move 
prep to the Roosevelt Room as soon as the President is free. 

SAM
I don’t believe he’s going to get anything on Cuba, but weíre working out an answer. 
Also on teachers. 

TOBY
Okay. [as Sam is walking out] Sam? Keep in touch with Peter Jobson and let me know as 
soon as it lands, would you? 

SAM
Yeah. 

Bonnie enters. 

BONNIE
Toby? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

BONNIE
CNN’s got the Nighthawk. 

TOBY
Thank you. 

CUT TO: EXT. ROCK CREEK PARKWAY - DAY
Josh and Hoynes are jogging towards the Lincoln Memorial.

JOSH
There was a reckless deregulation of the S&L industry by a Democratic Congress, it was 
flooded with S&L donations. A disaster which nearly collapsed the banking industry and 
cost the taxpayers 500 billion dollars. 

HOYNES
What’s your point? 

JOSH
We’re no better with the money than they are. 

HOYNES
Tell me about it. 

JOSH
Three-quarters of all soft money coming to the Democratic party isn’t coming from labor 
unions, it’s coming from corporations. 

HOYNES
Yes, I know. 

JOSH
Over a hundred businesses gave both parties in excess of $125,000 in the last election. 

HOYNES
I know. 

JOSH
They gave it to both parties! This isn’t free speech or political values, Mr. Vice 
President. I don’t know how we’ve done it, but we’ve legalized bribery. 

HOYNES
Yup. 

JOSH
So, now what we’ve got is two corporate parties - one pro-life, one pro-choice. 

HOYNES
Josh, like I said, what’s your point? I mean, what’s your point? 

JOSH
We’ve noticed the sudden increase in racquetball and late-night poker games with 
democratic opponents of campaign finance reform. 

HOYNES
Come on, Josh, this is Washington, DC, you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting a 
democratic opponent of campaign finance reform. 

JOSH
Can we stop running for a second? [They stop running] You’re backing the wrong horse. 
You read the same polls I do. President’s gone up nine points in three weeks. 51% job 
approval - big deal. But he’s going on national television tonight, that’s going to be 
another 5 that’s 56%, a 14-point bump in a month. 

HOYNES
Look, Josh...

JOSH
Hang on. If we bring this pilot back home alive, that’s another 10 points. And then 
we’re off to the races with a job approval rating in the high 60s. Now every Democratic 
congressman in a tight race is looking to get his picture taken with the president, 
and you’re looking around the racquetball court, saying, "Where did everybody go?" 
You’ve had some experience battling Jed Bartlet when he’s right, and you’ve had some 
experience battling him when he’s popular. Why in the world would you want to try it 
when he’s both at the same time? 

HOYNES
You know something, Josh, sometimes I wonder if I’d listened to you two years ago, 
would I be President right now? Do you ever wonder that? 

JOSH
No sir, I know it for sure. [on Hoynes’ nod] I’m done. Thank you for your time, sir. 

Josh walks off, Hoynes gestures to SS agents, and they continue jogging in the opposite 
direction.

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. enters with military officers to multiple camera flashes. 

C.J.
Good Afternoon. A U.S. Air Force F-117-A Nighthawk Stealth fighter attack aircraft flying
a routine patrol out of Al Jabar Air Force Base in Kuwait was shot down over the southern
no-fly zone in Iraq. At this point, we don’t know the condition of the pilot. We do know 
that the plane does carry an ACES II 0/0 ejector seat, and that is was activated. General 
Richmond and General Clancy will talk more about that in a moment. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! 

C.J.
Danny. 

DANNY
Is there a rescue mission underway? 

C.J.
Obviously there are a number of scenarios being contemplated, but I wouldn’t want to 
speculate. 

Leo is watching C.J. through the glass window in the back of the room.

C.J.
We have been in touch with the Iraqi government, and the President is looking for a 
diplomatic solution. 

DANNY [VO]
There have been no military moves? 

C.J.
No. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! 

C.J.
Chris. 

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Bartlet and his staff are preparing for the Town Hall meeting. 

MANDY
You could tag Congress as being obstructionist, but you have to first list your own 
accomplishments, or else you won’t have any credibility. 

Sam enters. 

BARTLET
Expanding healthcare coverage for 5 million more poor children. 

MANDY
Yes. 

BARTLET
Making healthcare portable for people who change jobs. 

MANDY
You can also list the agenda for the coming year. 

BARTLET
You know what’s hard about all this, C.J.? 

C.J.
Sir? 

BARTLET
I’m rehearsing here without the pitcher and glass, it’s totally weird for me. 

C.J.
Yeah. 

MANDY
How do you feel about him taking off his jacket? 

SAM
No. 

MANDY
I like it. 

SAM
It’ll look staged. 

MANDY
Not if he does it at the right moment. 

SAM
What’s he going to do, throw it over his shoulder? 

MANDY
Maybe. 

SAM
I’m also not wild about the hand-held mike. Can we get him wired? 

BARTLET
No, because with the mike and the stool, and the jacket thrown over my shoulder, 
and I can do the town hall meeting, and then do a couple of sets at the Copa. 

Zoey knocks on the door, and then enters with Charlie. 

ZOEY
Hey. 

BARTLET
My musical director, Zoey Bartlet. 

ZOEY
Are you working? 

BARTLET
We’re down to do I or do I not take my jacket off. 

He goes out into the HALLWAY to talk to Zoey.

ZOEY
Do you want to know what I think? 

BARTLET
I honestly couldn’t care less. Listen, I want you to come with us tonight. 

ZOEY
Dad, I was... are you sweating? 

BARTLET
I’m fine. 

ZOEY
Are you sure? 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

ZOEY
Did you take your pills? 

BARTLET
Zoey! 

ZOEY
Fine, then, go ahead and collapse. 

BARTLET
Are you channeling Mom, now? 

ZOEY
Dad 

BARTLET
Come to Virginia tonight. 

ZOEY
I can watch on TV. 

BARTLET
It’s not like being there in person. 

ZOEY
You’re going to talk about me, and the camera’s going to go on me, and my face is going 
to turn red, and it’s just going to be awful for me. 

BARTLET
Bonus. Then it’s settled. 

ZOEY
Listen. Charlie wanted to say something during prep. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

ZOEY
I’m going to go see Mom. 

BARTLET
And you’re coming tonight. 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Thanks. [to Gina, who’s waiting near the door] Gina. 

He goes back into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM.

BARTLET
All right, everyone, we’re done. Thanks very much. 

STAFF
Thanks, Mr. President. Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET
Charlie, Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention? 

CHARLIE
I’m sorry, sir? 

BARTLET
Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention. 

CHARLIE
No, sir. 

BARTLET
Are you sure? 

CHARLIE
Yes, sir, there was justI’m sorry, sir, there was just a misunderstanding. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

SAM
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

SAM
I was thinking that it might not be a bad idea to have a signal worked out. 

BARTLET
A signal for what? 

SAM
Good news regarding the pilot, if it comes while you’re on television. 

BARTLET
What kind of signal did you have in mind? 

SAM
Something like this.

He makes a slow, upward wavy motion.

SAM
Very subtle, very simple. 

BARTLET
What is that? 

SAM
It’s departure. It’s a safe departure. Would you like a different signal? 

BARTLET
No, that one’s good. 

SAM
Should I spread it around? 

BARTLET
Well, I think it’s going to get around all by itself, but if you want to help it along 
a little, there’s nothing wrong with that. 

SAM
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Bartlet makes the signal to Sam, who makes it back at him.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh enters.

LEO
Hey, Josh. 

JOSH
What’s going on? 

LEO
I just talked to Hoynes. 

JOSH
Is he in? 

LEO
Yeah. He’s on board. You did a good job. 

JOSH
Good. 

LEO
Josh? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

LEO
Did you happen to say to him that if Scott Hutchins comes back alive, there’ll be a ten 
point bump? 

JOSH
I did. 

LEO
I gotta tell you, if the President ever heard about that, he’d be out of his skin. 

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
Even in private! 

JOSH
I was just...

LEO
The guy’s been blown out of the sky! He might be seriously injured. For sure he’s in an 
Iraqi desert with no water. He’s got to keep radio silence because we’re for sure not the 
only ones looking for him, and if they get to him first, all he gives them is his name, 
rank, and serial number, they’re going to beat him.

JOSH
They’re going to torture him. This is to say nothing of the 80 guys in a helicopter who 
are going to get shot at if they’re picked up underneath the radar. 

JOSH
You’re right. 

LEO
I know the President’s been joking around all day. But he’s been living and dying with 
this every hour, and I know he’d be really offended if he knew that you were discussing 
a political upside. And I gotta tell you, Josh, as a guy who flew planes in the war, 
I was really offended, too. 

JOSH
Yes, sir. 

LEO
Okay. 

JOSH
Okay. 

LEO
Now, you did good today. I’m just saying that there’s a way to be a person. 

JOSH
I apologize. 

LEO
Your apology’s accepted. 

Leo semi-reaches out, Josh moves in for a hug. 

LEO 
[stopping him] What are you doing? 

JOSH
It looked like you wanted to hug me. 

LEO
Oh, man, did you read that wrong. 

JOSH
Okay. 

LEO 
[stops him as he’s leaving] Hey, Sam was here before. We’ve got some kind of signal? 

JOSH
Yeah, for if we know something during the town hall. 

LEO
Could be days. 

JOSH
Maybe not. 

LEO
What is the signal? 

JOSH
It’s this. [demonstrates the signal] 

LEO
What is that? 

JOSH
It’s the signal. 

LEO
It looks like a hip-hop gesture. 

JOSH
It’s, uh, a plane taking off. 

LEO
Doesn’t look like a plane taking off. 

JOSH 
[repeats it again] It means something good has happened. [does the signal going down 
instead of up] This means something bad has happened. [does the signal going up] 
This means something good has happened. 

LEO
I’ve got it. 

JOSH
You don’t have to be a cryptographer. 

LEO
I said I’ve got it. 

JOSH
Leo. I really do apologize. 

LEO
Thank you. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Charlie catches up with Zoey and Gina. 

CHARLIE
Zoey, can I talk to you for a minute? 

ZOEY
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
I can’t believe you did that. 

ZOEY
You needed prompting. I can’t believe you chickened out. 

CHARLIE
I didn’t chicken out. And I didn’t need prompting. It just wasn’t appropriate.

He leads her into JOSH'S OFFICE.

CHARLIE
I don’t have the same relationship with your father that you have, I don’t have the same
relationship that the staff has. 

ZOEY
I don’t think it’s out of line for you to put your two cents in. 

Josh walks in. 

JOSH
Hi. 

CHARLIE
I’m sorry, we were just using your office for a minute. 

JOSH
You can keep fighting in just a second, I just need to find something. 

ZOEY
I also don’t think it was out of line for me to stick up for you, since you were clearly 
chicken. 

CHARLIE
Zoey, I work in a building with the smartest people in the world... 

Josh goes to sit down on his non-existent chair and Zoey and Charlie watch him fall to 
the floor. Gina pops her head in, concerned. 

JOSH 
[sitting up] Donna! 

Donna enters. 

DONNA
Hi. 

JOSH
How you doing? 

DONNA
We should get something temporary so that doesn’t happen. 

JOSH
Yeah.

Charlie and Zoey walk out. 

CHARLIE
Anyway, I wish you wouldn’t do that anymore. 

ZOEY
Okay. But you’re wrong. I’ll see you later. 

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Sam approaches and knocks on door. 

TOBY
Come in. What do you know? 

SAM
Listen...

TOBY
Sam. 

SAM
No, it’s not... Cathy’s getting Peter Jobson on the phone for you, he’s going to tell 
you about this. 

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
There was a screw-up when they closed the door. They were doing something, which is 
called a manual winch op, which means they disconnect the motor from the door, and 
somehow either as a result of that, or of something completely unrelated, the two OMS 
engines are failing. OMS are the orbital maneuvering systems. 

TOBY
Do you know if they have primary RCS? 

SAM
That’s what they’re trying now. 

Toby nods tersely.

SAM
Toby. If this were at a certain level, they would call the President. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
Seriously. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
Anyway, Cathy’s getting Peter Jobson. 

TOBY
Before, when you first asked me, the reason I reacted the way I didI was just embarrassed.
Cause honestly, I forgot he was up there. They had switched his mission order around a 
couple of times and I just lost track of it. 

Cathy enters.

Cathy
Toby, Peter Jobson’s on line 5. 

Toby picks up the phone. 

TOBY 
[to Sam and Cathy] Thank you. 

Sam and Cathy leave. Toby starts to talk on the phone.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is lying on the couch. Charlie enters. 

CHARLIE
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

CHARLIE
Admiral Fitzwallace told me that he’s on his way over. 

BARTLET
Thanks. 

CHARLIE
Would you like anything? 

BARTLET
No. Hey, what was it that Zoey was talking about before? 

Bartlet gets up, pulls pills out of his pocket, and drinks them with a glass of water 
on his desk.

CHARLIE
It was nothing, sir. 

BARTLET
What was it? 

CHARLIE
It was uh, it was a report that’s been sitting on your desk for a few weeks. 

BARTLET
It has? 

CHARLIE
Well, my desk, really. And so, I was reading it, and so I was reading it, and during 
prep this week, you’ve been having discussions with the senior staff about youth 
participation in the political process. You were saying...

BARTLET
What’s the report? 

CHARLIE
It’s from a group called the Center for Policy Alternatives. And there’s some things 
that hit home with me, and I mentioned it to Zoeyy, and that’s why...

Mrs. Landingham enters, interrupting. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Chairman Fitzwallace. 

BARTLET
Thank you. 

Mrs. Landingham exits.

BARTLET
Charlie, whatever it is, stick it in my briefcase, would you? 

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you. 

Fitzwallace enters as Charlie is leaving. 

FITZWALLACE
Charlie. 

CHARLIE
Sir. 

FITZWALLACE
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Fitz, do you have any news at all?

FITZWALLACE
Actually, I think I might have something in a minute. They’ll put the call through here. 

BARTLET
Okay.

FITZWALLACE
Mind if I wait with you, sir? 

BARTLET
No. 

Fitzwallace sits on the couch and Bartlet in the armchair. 

FITZWALLACE
How you feeling? 

BARTLET
I feel fine. 

FITZWALLACE
Yeah? 

BARTLET
Yeah, I feel fine.

Fitzwallace looks down at the carpet.
 
FITZWALLACE
The eagle on the seal in the carpet. In one talon he’s holding arrows, and in the other 
an olive branch. Most of the time, the eagle’s facing the olive branch, but when Congress 
declares war, the eagle faces the talons. How do they do that? You think they’ve got a 
second carpet sitting around in the basement someplace? 

BARTLET
I don’t know. 

FITZWALLACE
Maybe this piece in the middle cuts out and they do it like a basketball court. 

BARTLET
I honestly don’t know, Fitz.

Mrs. Landingham comes in. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Excuse me, Chairman, that’s your call, the blinking light. 

FITZWALLACE
Thank you. I’ll stop bugging you in just a minute Mr. President. [into phone] Yeah? 
Thanks. [to Bartlet] Mr. President, I have Captain Scott Hutchins on the phone, he’s 
cleared Iraqi airspace, and he’s on his way to Tel Aviv. 

BARTLET
Fitz...

FITZWALLACE
Congratulations, Sir. 

BARTLET
The kid’s all right? 

FITZWALLACE
Sprained ankle. 

BARTLET
Well, that’s, that’s a job awfully well done, Mr. Chairman. 

FITZWALLACE
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
I owe you one.

FITZWALLACE
No, that’s not how it works. 

BARTLET
All the same, I’m going to check out that thing with the carpet. 

FITZWALLACE
Talk to the pilot. [goes to leave] 

BARTLET
Seriously, I’m going to get an answer for you on that. 

Fitzwallace leaves, Bartlet picks up the phone.

BARTLET
Captain Hutchins, this is President Bartlet. How’s your ankle? Good. Now before you say 
another word, give me your parents’ phone number. I never get to make this call.  

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

C.J.
Radar officers aboard the Minneapolis monitored Captain Hutchins as his plane went what 
is called "Feet Dry" south of the 33rd parallel. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! 

C.J.
Katie. 

KATIE
Did we use Saudi Arabian airspace, and if so, was it with the Saudis’ permission? 

C.J.
We did use Saudi airspace, we flew secretly on the way in, they were informed of the 
mission on the way out. 

REPORTER
Is that when the British were told? 

C.J.
That’s when the British were told.

REPORTERS
C.J.! 

C.J.
Folks, it’s a few minutes after seven. Most of us have to pile into buses to get over to 
Arlington. All this material will be covered in much greater detail at the Pentagon 
briefing, which will take place 30 minutes after our return. That’s all for now. 

C.J. exits as the reporters call her name. Danny gets up to go after her.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

CAROL
Nice! 

C.J.
I have to congratulate you, Carol. I was afraid I was going to see Saudi Arabia spelled 
with a ‘y’. 

CAROL
C.J., I’m a much better speller than you give me credit for. 

C.J.
Yes. One "l" in Tel Aviv. 

CAROL
Okay. 

Danny catches up to them. 

DANNY
C.J.! 

C.J.
In my office. 

They go into C.J.'S OFFICE. 

C.J.
Danny, I don’t even want to hear it. I did exactly the right thing. Your nose is bent out 
of joint, and I don’t give a damn. 

DANNY
You looked at me point-blank and told me you were looking at a diplomatic... 

C.J.
Danny...

DANNY
You looked at me and told me...

C.J.
What did you think I was going to do, Danny? Give you longitude and latitude? Did you 
think I was going to fork over the radio frequency that we’re transmitting on?

DANNY
You didn’t have to answer the question. 

C.J.
I did! 

DANNY
You could have said, "Danny, we’re not ruling anything in or out, and I’m not going to 
let you take me down that path" and we would have been done with it. 

C.J.
Danny, if by standing up and lying, I misdirected Iraqi intelligence for even half a 
beat, then it was absolutely worth it. That’s a no-brainer. And if I didn’t, it was 
certainly worth trying. There were only 50 people in the world who can’t understand why 
I lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I’m sleeping fine 
tonight. 

DANNY
You didn’t have to call on me. Every hand shot up, everybody’s hand shot up, everybody 
was going to ask the same question, you knew what your answer was going to be, and you 
called on me. 

C.J.
Well, yes, I did. 

DANNY
And you wouldn’t have rather done that to a journalist that’s been less supportive of 
this administration than I have? 

C.J.
No, I chose you. 

DANNY
C.J., I’m not staying in the penalty box forever. I’ve covered the White House for eight 
years, and I’ve done it for the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time Magazine, and 
the Dallas Morning News! And I’m telling you, you can’t mess me around like this. 

C.J.
Danny, I got to tell you, that was, seriously, that was a turn-on when you said that, 
though I don’t know why you decided to be the most haughty on the Dallas Morning News. 

DANNY
C.J..

Carol enters. 

CAROL
The buses are leaving. 

C.J. 
[to Danny, who's still fuming] The buses are leaving. 

C.J. exits.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet and Leo are exiting.

LEO
Girls' softball? 

BARTLET
Womens' softball. It’s going to be great. Mrs. Landingham? I’m watching a live sporting 
event from beginning to end tonight. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
And when Sacramento State and the University of the Pacific get together, it’s usually 
a barnburner, sir. 

BARTLET
You’re not going to spoil my good time for me, Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Oh, sir, I think we both know from experience that’s not true. 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You needed to be in the car ten minutes ago, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Do you see me walking out the door?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
No, I see you standing and arguing with a senior citizen. 

BARTLET
I’m leaving. 

He leaves, with Leo behind. 

LEO
Sam’s got some notes for you on Cuba, and some notes on farm loans that I’d like you 
to look over in the car. 

BARTLET 
[handing Leo his briefcase] You know what, I'll be at the car in just a second. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you. 

He heads off in the opposite direction.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet enters. Toby’s looking out the window.

BARTLET
Toby? 

No reaction.

BARTLET
Toby. 

TOBY
Excuse me, Mr. President. I’m sorry. 

BARTLET
You can’t see them, they’re over Australia now. I just spoke with the mission commander. 
They’re trying firing something called an RCS? 

TOBY
Yeah, it’s the reaction control system. It’s actually 40 separate engines around the 
shuttle. 

BARTLET
If that doesn’t work, they’ve got about 39 other things they can try. There’s redundancy 
after redundancy after redundancy built in. And for good measure, they have Atlantis 
warming up on the launch pad. It can dock with the Columbia in about two hours. We can 
do that now, Toby. 

TOBY
First thing the shuttle does after it leaves the atmosphere is open the cargo bay doors. 
That’s what lets the heat out. Once those doors close, they have a pretty short window to 
get back before it overheats. 

BARTLET
Then they’ll open those doors again. 

TOBY
How? 

BARTLET
Same way they closed them - with a five-dollar wrench. 

TOBY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
When we’re done tonight, you should take the next flight out to Edwards’ Air Force Base, 
meet the thing when it lands, stop being a horse’s ass, and talk to your brother. 

TOBY
Mr. President. I appreciate you trying to be a comfort, and I appreciate that you have 
some understanding of the situation with my brother. But the thing was supposed to land 
19 hours ago. Obviously, there’s a problem. It’s space travel, and I don’t believe any 
problem is minor. 

BARTLET
Shuttle flies itself, Toby. 

TOBY
No, it doesn’t, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
No, it doesn’t. 

Bartlet exits. Toby slowly puts on his jacket and follows him out.

FADE TO: INT. THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT 
Bartlet is already on the STAGE. 

BARTLET
Thank you, thank you very much. That was a joke about politicians. [audience laughter] 
Two politicians are having an argument. The first one yells, 'but you’re lying!' and the 
other one answers, ‘yes, I know, but hear me out!" 

Gina walks on the CATWALK. 

GINA 
[to the other agent] We’re moments away. I’m going to get the door. 

BARTLET
I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer 
to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like. A man once said this, 
"decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? 
[hand shake] A little of both. There’s a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed 
me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with 
the statement "The older generation has failed my generation". When asked how the older 
generation sees you, your top answers are "lazy", "confused," and "unfocused". 

Josh watches in the LOBBY.

Reporter
What was that source again? 

JOSH
Center for Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for you on the bus ride back. 

BARTLET
If I take my jacket off, can I trust you all to read nothing more into it than I’ve been 
talking for two hours and it’s a little hot under these lights? 

The audience applauds, and Bartlet takes off his jacket.

In the PRESS AREA, C.J. walks behind the reporters. She hits Danny in the back of 
the head. 

C.J.
Follow me. 

DANNY
Why? [follows her] 

Bonnie approaches Sam in the CONTROL ROOM. 

BONNIE
Where’s Toby? 

SAM
Why? 

BONNIE
He’s got a phone call. 

SAM
From who? 

BONNIE
Peter Jobson. 

SAM
Give it to me. 

Toby in the HALLWAY watches the President talk.

SAM
Toby? 

Sam makes "the signal" when Toby turns around. Toby nods in relief. Toby makes the
signal down in the lobby to Josh, and then turns around and sighs in relief. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS
Gina walks out to Ron. 

RON
Gina! Straight to the car. 

GINA
He’s not going to work the rope line? 

RON
There’s a softball game the President wants to watch. 

GINA
They show softball on TV? 

RON
Well, yeah. 

GINA
And the president watches it?   

Gina and Ron walk past a menacing looking young man wearing a cap, gray shirt, 
and the biggest "Bartlet" button in the world. He watches them pass, and then turns his 
attention to an office building window on the other side of the alley.

CUT TO: INT. NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is still on the stage. 

BARTLET
They’re telling me that we’re out of time. I just want to mention that at several points 
during the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist, and a fellow 
fourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven’t heard that for a 
while. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS
Gina looks over the crowd apprehensively. 

BARTLET [VO]
Actually, I’m an economics professor. My great-grandfather’s great-grandfather was Dr. 
Josiah Bartlet, who was the New Hampshire delegate to the second Continental Congress, 
the one that sat in session in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776...

CUT TO: INT. THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS

BARTLET
...and announced to the world that we were no longer subjects of King George III, but 
rather a self-governing people. We hold these truths to be self-evident, they said, 
that all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in 
history that anyone had bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who 
show up. Class dismissed. Thank you, everyone. God bless you. And God bless America. 

The audience applauds.

JOSH
Way to go. 

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS
Gina looks very apprehensively at the crowd. She looks right past creepy looking young 
guy, who’s looking right at her.

GINA
He’s not working the rope line. [into wrist mike] Straight to the car. I’ve got Bookbag.

Bartlet and his staff are walking down to the limos. 

ZOEY
He used it, you’re feeling good about it, and you’re looking for a way to thank me. 

CHARLIE
It had nothing to do with you, and you were still unbelievably wrong. 

ZOEY
I accept your apology. 

BARTLET
Toby! Walk with me. 

TOBY
Yes, sir? 

BARTLET
What have you got to say for yourself? 

TOBY
About what? 

Bartlet makes "the signal".

TOBY
[chuckling] Yes, sir!  

In the office building, bad men are loading ammunition. The creepy boy looks up at the 
office window. Gina meets Zoey at the end of gate before the limos.

ZOEY [to Gina]
...baby pictures he keeps heckling me with, visa card bills. And look, now he’s walking 
the ropeline. If ever there is a chance that he’ll pass a crowd of people... 

Bartlet happy as a clam, works the ropeline. 

ZOEY
Charlie! 

GINA
I saw something. 

ZOEY
Charlie apologized to me. A full apology. 

GINA
I saw something! 

The skinheads in the office building are looking down at the scene. Gina looks around 
frantically, spotting the creepy boy looking up at the office building past her head. 

ZOEY [VO]
Gina? 

The creepy boy turns to walk away and his cap is knocked off, revealing a "skinned" head.
Gina turns around to see what he’s looking at. Charlie turns with her. The skinheads in 
the office building raises their guns. Just as the first shot is about to go off, 
Gina yells. 

GINA
GUN!

Gina turns, knocks Charlie to the ground by the limo. 
The skinheads shoots into the crowd. 
Secret Service Agents and passersby are scurrying. 
Gina pulls Zoey down and shields her from the gunfire, yelling, "get down, get down!" 
The agents fire up at the shooters. 
Some of them pull Bartlet back and down. 
Gina shoves Zoey into the limo. 
Josh looks behind the gates in horror. 
Agents fire, the crowd screaming and scurrying.
Secret Service snipers fire at the gunmen. 
The gunmen fire at the crowd.
Agents shove Bartlet into a limo. 
An agent knocks into C.J., who’s standing next to Sam. 
A police car’s top. Its light shatters. 
Sam tackles [or falls into] C.J., bringing them both to the ground as a limo window 
shatters right in front of them. 
Firing guns. 
Scurrying crowds.
Toby caught on the ground at the bottom of the gate.
Leo being held down onto the ground by SS agents, saying, "stay down!" 
Overhead shot of scurrying crowds, one limo towards the background, one, possibly two, 
people lying prone, face-down on the ground in front of it. 

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.

AGENTS [VO]
Oh, god, we’ve got people down. People down, people down! Who’s been hit? Who’s been hit?

FADE TO BLACK.
